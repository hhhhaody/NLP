President Biden’s nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra declined to assure lawmakers on Wednesday that there would be no federal "takeover" of health care if he is confirmed to the post.

Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said during the hearing that he strongly supports private insurance and allowing consumers to choose coverage that best meets their needs, but he noted Becerra has a "longstanding support for single-payer government-run health care."

"What assurances can you give to Americans who currently have private insurance, including through Medicare Advantage, and are satisfied with their insurance provider, that they will not lose their coverage in the future to some sort of Medicare for All approach or other federal takeover … of health care?" Crapo asked.

In response, Becerra steered clear of a specific assurance of private insurance and said that his main prerogative will be following through on Biden’s promises, including expanding the Affordable Care Act.

"We will both agree that the most important thing is to give everyone in this country coverage, good coverage, and what I will tell you is I’m here at the pleasure of the president of the United States – he’s made it very clear where he is," Becerra said. "He wants to build on the Affordable Care Act – that will be my mission to achieve the goals the president Biden put forward."

Biden has said he is not in favor of a single-payer system.

Conservatives have raised concerns about Becerra’s track record, including comments made about a potential Medicare for All system.

Becerra said in a 2017 interview with Fox News that he "absolutely" supports Medicare for All and had done so for all 24 years.

"As attorney general, I would fight for that if we had an opportunity to put that forward in the state of California because I think what we do is we give people that certainty that they’re going to be able to access a doctor or a hospital," Becerra said at the time.

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., made similar comments when he lauded Biden’s decision to tap the former California lawmaker, tweeting in December:

.@AGBecerra supported Medicare for all, has stood up to pharmaceutical companies, and can work to give states federal waivers for single payer systems. He is a strong choice and has always worked well with progressives.

If confirmed, Becerra’s position might potentially give him the authority to grant waivers to states to allow them to set up a single-payer system – or expand the public option – via the Affordable Care Act.

However, Becerra is also a proponent of the Affordable Care Act – saying in a June briefing that the system has been "life-changing," specifically during the pandemic, as reported by The New York Times.

"It's incumbent upon all of us who deal with sensitive and classified information on a regular basis to make sure that people who have access to that information are not tainted," Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., told "America Reports".

"Now, that's all we're asking to do, is get a [FBI] briefing so that we can make a determination whether there is a problem."

House Republicans are requesting that FBI Director Christopher Wray hold a briefing to inform them of the "full extent" of Chinese intelligence operations targeting members of Congress.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS REQUEST FBI BRIEFING ON SWALWELL

The concern about Swalwell began in December, when Axios reported that Fang had targeted up-and-coming local politicians, including those who had the potential to become national figures.

As part of that effort, Fang reportedly took part in fundraising for Swalwell’s 2014 reelection campaign -- and had developed "close ties" to Swalwell’s office.

While Swalwell remains a major concern among Congressional Republicans, Katko and other lawmakers are also urging the Biden administration to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, arguing that American athletes competing in an event hosted by the communist country would serve to "capitulate or rationalize their conduct."

HOUSE REPUBLICANS URGE BIDEN TO BOYCOTT 2022 OLYMPICS IN BEIJING

"I'm very, very concerned about what's going on with respect to the Olympics in Beijing next year, considering the fact that they're engaged in massive human rights violations, including genocide on a large scale," Katko told Fox News host John Roberts.

"They are literally gathering up millions ... maybe as many as three million ethnic Muslims, primarily Uyghurs, in concentration camps. And they are systematically engaging in genocide with them as defined by the United Nations."

In a letter addressed to Biden, Katko explained that he wants the U.S. to compete in the Olympics, "but I don't want them to compete in a country that's engaged in genocide," he told Roberts.

"It's absolutely the wrong signal to send to people around the world."

Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.Moderna on Wednesday announced that the COVID-19 vaccine it recently developed to address a concerning new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is ready to be tested in humans in clinical trials.

Moderna in a news release said that it has shipped the first batch of doses of the new jab to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to commence a Phase 1 clinical trial "that will be led and funded by the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)."

The new vaccine candidate, dubbed mRNA-1273.351, was created to better address the South African variant after the company’s existing vaccine — the second COVID-19 vaccine to see emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) late last year — was found to have reduced efficacy against the mutation.

In a study published last week, the biotech giant said its existing COVID-19 jab was found to have a six-fold reduction in vaccine-induced antibodies against the B.1.351 variant. (Despite this reduction, however, "neutralizing titer levels with B.1.351 remain above levels that are expected to be protective," the company said.)

MILLIONS OF FAKE N95 MASKS SHIPPED TO MULTIPLE STATES, FEDS SAY

Moderna said Wednesday it plans to study three variations of a booster. First, it will study the variant-specific jab, which will be given at a lower dose than its original vaccine, and, also like its original vaccine, will require an evaluation and emergency use approval from the FDA before it can be distributed to the public, should the results of the trial prove promising.

Secondly, Moderna said it plans to study a combination of the original vaccine and the variant-specific one in a single jab at 50 micrograms or lower. Lastly, it will study the effects of a third dose of its original vaccine, but at a lower dosage.

"Moderna is committed to making as many updates to our vaccine as necessary until the pandemic is under control," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement. "We hope to demonstrate that booster doses, if necessary, can be done at lower dose levels, which will allow us to provide many more doses to the global community in late 2021 and 2022 if necessary."

The news of the booster comes just a month after Moderna said it was working on one. Like its first COVID-19 jab, the new vaccine candidate was also created using groundbreaking mRNA technology.

In addition to Moderna, other vaccine makers — including Pfizer, the creator of the first COVID-19 vaccine to see emergency approval in the U.S., as well as Johnson & Johnson — have said they are working on vaccines to better combat variants.A 16-year-old girl was killed and a teen boy was injured after they slipped through an icy lake in Ohio — and a police officer died during the rescue attempt, officials said.

The drowning was reported just before 6:30 p.m. Tuesday near a private dock on the north side of Rocky Fork Lake, according to news station WCPO.

The boy, who was only identified as a 13-year–old, tried to locate the girl under the ice before he freed himself, authorities said.

Divers ultimately pulled the girl from the lake around 11 p.m. — after four hours of being trapped under the ice — but she succumbed to her injuries later in the hospital, WCPO reported.

An Ohio Natural Resources Department police officer who responded to the call also died after he suffered a medical emergency during the rescue attempt, the outlet reported.

Officer Jason Lagore fell ill shortly after arriving at the scene and was brought to the hospital, but he was unable to be resuscitated, officials said.

No further details were released about the circumstances surrounding his death.

"Our hearts are with the family and loved ones of Officer Jason Lagore, who died in the line of duty last night," Ohio Department of Natural Resources Director Mary Mertz said. "Our law enforcement officers and their families carry a unique and challenging burden of responsibilities, and we are deeply grateful for their service."

The new rules are proof "that the force is evolving and making a concerted effort to make everyone feel included," Master Sgt. Quintana Mitchell, the uniform policy NCO for G-1, said in unveiling the changes last month.

Soldiers will now be allowed to have highlights in their hair as long as it appears natural.

ARMY IMPROVES ABRAMS TANK GUN SYSTEM WITH UPGRADED FIRE CONTROL

Sgt. Maj. Brian Sanders, senior enlisted leader of Army G-1’s uniform policy branch, said that the Army "cannot assume that a Soldier's hair should be a specific color" based on their complexion.

Neon colors and other bright pigments such as pink and green are still not allowed.

Hair can also be less than 1/4 inches and soldiers are allowed to wear multiple hairstyles at once under the new regulations.

Ponytails will also be allowed for female soldiers with medium-length hair "if the individual's hair length or texture prevents them from securing it into a tight bun."

Female soldiers can now wear earrings with their Army Combat Uniform, but not in the field or in combat. Certain types of nail polish and lipstick will also be permitted.

A panel of 15 female soldiers and two male soldiers proposed the changes after examining them for seven months.

"The reason I picked up a golf club 🤯 Yesterday was a pretty cool day! Thank you @tigerwoods @golfdigest for this dope opportunity!" Wade wrote on his Instagram.

Wade also posted a video with Woods, where the pro golfer poked fun at the ex-basketball star.

Wade made an appearance on "Inside the NBA" on Tuesday to talk about his time with Woods on the golf course.

When asked during testimony before Congress on Wednesday whether he would consider granting waivers to give health care benefits to illegal immigrants as HHS secretary — given his history of supporting the policy — Becerra said his interpretation of the law as it stands does not support that.

"Where the law as it stands now as I see it, it does not allow those who are unauthorized in this country to receive taxpayer-paid benefits except in very rare circumstances," Becerra said. "And it will be my job to make sure that we are following and enforcing the law."

GOP SENATORS QUESTION BECERRA QUALIFICATIONS TO LEAD HHS, PAST VOTE AGAINST PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN

As noted by Politico, in 2009 Becerra had been hoping for more health care options under the Affordable Care Act for illegal immigrants, and he engaged in discussions with Barack Obama to try to have those options included. Ultimately, they were not, as Becerra alluded to on Wednesday.

Becerra said Obama’s decision to compromise with Republicans was "more than disturbing."

California submitted a request to the Obama administration in 2016 that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to buy health care plans in the state. That request was withdrawn in 2017.

If confirmed to serve as HHS Secretary, Becerra would have the authority to potentially grant waivers allowing undocumented immigrants to have access to the health care exchanges.

That has become a focal point among Becerra’s GOP opponents, like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who claimed Becerra would decriminalize illegal immigration and "extend expensive government benefits like Medicaid to anyone who illegally crosses our borders."

Becerra, who is the child of immigrants, said his focus on health care as a right was born out of his personal experience.

"We knew we could go to the doctor — and everybody should know that," Becerra said during an interview with California Healthline. "For me, health care is a right. I’ve been a single-payer advocate all my life."Several witnesses have been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is already facing state murder charges in the death of George Floyd, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

The Justice Department’s federal civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, according to the person, who could not publicly discuss the non-public proceedings and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

The New York Times first reported that a grand jury was hearing testimony against Chauvin. The Justice Department declined to comment.

Jury selection begins in Chavin’s state case on March 8 — he faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges — with opening statements scheduled for March 29.

CHICAGO POLICE RIPPED OVER GEORGE FLOYD UNREST RESPONSE IN SCATHING NEW WATCHDOG REPORT

Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while he was handcuffed and saying he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death sparked protests in Minneapolis and beyond and led to a nationwide reckoning on systemic racism and police brutality.

Three other officers — Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao — are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to face trial in August. Like Chauvin, all three were fired soon after Floyd’s death.

The increased federal grand jury activity in connection with Floyd’s death comes as the Justice Department, under President Joe Biden, is expected to focus more on civil rights issues, criminal justice overhauls and policing policies in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.

At his confirmation hearing this week, Judge Merrick Garland, Biden’s nominee for attorney general, emphasized his commitment to combating racial discrimination in policing, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that America doesn’t "yet have equal justice."

NY PROTESTER, 75, SHOVED BY BUFFALO POLICE FILES LAWSUIT AFTER COPS' CHARGES DROPPED

Former Attorney General William Barr had previously said that, as is standard department policy, the Justice Department was first going to allow a state prosecution to move forward before the federal investigation would be resolved. It’s unclear what specifically prompted the increased grand jury activity in the last few weeks, though most federal grand juries are discharged after about 18 months.

Chauvin was prepared to plead guilty to a state charge of third-degree murder in Floyd’s death before Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year, two law enforcement officials with direct knowledge of the talks told the AP. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon as the investigation into Floyd’s death was still in its relative infancy, the officials said.

Sports fans all over the world showed their support for Woods, who suffered "multiple leg injuries" after being involved in a "single-vehicle roll-over" collision on the border of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes in Los Angeles at around 7:12 a.m. local time on Tuesday.

A statement was posted on Woods’ official Twitter account early Wednesday. It included a quote from Dr. Anish Mahajan, who is the chief medical officer and interim CEO of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. He said that Woods is recovering from a long surgical procedure to repair "significant orthopedic injuries to his right lower extremity."

"Comminuted open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones were stabilized by inserting a rod into the tibia," Mahajan explained. "Additional injuries to the bones of the foot and ankle were stabilized with a combination of screws and pins."

Fox News' David Aaro contributed to this report.Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán gave a public apology Wednesday for actions that led to a lengthy suspension under Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy, a day after he spoke with New York teammates and admitted he had engaged in dangerous conduct.

Speaking softly and dabbing his eyes at times, Germán said through a translator he wanted "to sincerely apologize to the Steinbrenner family, my teammates, the front office and those around me who love me. I have made mistakes of which I’m not proud of."

The 28-year-old has been welcomed by teammates but also faced wariness as he attempts to regain a place in the starting rotation.

"He messed up in life," first baseman Luke Voit said. "I don’t know the things he did. You always get a second chance at this. We have his back. But he’s skating on thin ice, and he needs to get his life together. And I think he’s doing the right steps to do so. But, again, he’s got to prove to us that he can do that."

Germán was placed on administrative leave on Sept. 19, 2019 while MLB investigated an alleged domestic violence incident involving his girlfriend, with whom he has at least one child.

Germán missed the final nine games of the 2019 regular season and all nine of New York’s postseason games, then on Jan. 2, 2020, was suspended for 63 games. He missed the entire pandemic-shortened 2020 season and the playoffs. He returned to the Yankees last week for the start of spring training.

"I was able to speak to each player on the team yesterday. The only acceptable way to begin to move forward was to address them face to face," Germán said during a Zoom news conference from the Yankees minor league complex in Tampa, Florida, speaking in Spanish with a translator at his side. "What I told the team: There are a lot of young players who wear this uniform and I want them to understand the great damage that can be done when mistakes like mine have been made."

Giancarlo Stanton thought it was a positive exchange.

"It was very smart to address to the team, just to get it out there, get it in the room and move forward from here," he said. "It was definitely a big mistake he made, and he understands that. At the same time, it’s, ‘What are you doing to do with that mistake?’"

Germán was 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 2019 when he was put on leave.

"When my team needed me the most in 2019 before we started the playoffs, I wasn’t there for them. And for that, I ask your forgiveness," he said. "It was very difficult for me not to be pitching and helping my team. Having to watch from afar, hurt me a lot. But I also understand I am responsible for putting myself in that position."

Germán hopes to earn a spot in a rotation projected to include Gerrit Cole, Jordan Montgomery and newcomers Jameson Taillon and Corey Kluber. Manager Aaron Boone said Germán is competing with Deivi García, Michael King, Asher Wojciechowski, Jhoulys Chacín and Nick Nelson.

"He has done enough to earn the opportunity to be here and to compete and to be a part of this team," Boone said. "Now, the proof is in the daily life that he leads. And we’re certainly going to do all we can to support him and help him to become the best version of himself possible."

Germán thanked Boone, general manager Brian Cashman and pitching coach Matt Blake for visiting him in Jupiter, Florida.

"They have always sincerely tried to help me. When I was going through my worst moment, they were there," Germán said. "We had a great conversation. And for that I will be eternally grateful to them. I need to show them through my actions how committed I am to re-establishing myself as a contributor to this team."

Germán underwent mandatory counseling, which he said was beneficial.

He also addressed his social media account. He wrote last week in Spanish: "Everything is over" then deleted his posts and wrote: "I’m ready." He said he was trying to convey the suspension period was behind him and was trying to dedicate it as a thank you to his partner, with whom he remains together.

"Regarding social media, I understand that I have not used it in an appropriate way. I have caused a lot of confusion," he said. "And although my reason has been to connect with fans, I must do it in a better way. It is clear that I must improve on that."

Germán would not discuss the events that led to his suspension.

"I don’t think I want to get into the fine details of what happened that night," he said.

Germán said his actions and behavior will show he is safe for his partner to be around.

"We talked about it a lot, many, many, many times. And we’ve promised to each other not to go through something like this ever again," he said. "And I think that has been the best way for us to really get through all this and creating a safe environment, is just communicating and understanding each other in a better way."

Germán said he had not spoken directly with owner Hal Steinbrenner. He said he understood why Yankees reliever Zack Britton said last week: "I think sometimes you don’t get to control who your teammates are."

"He gave me really good advice, which I’m thankful for," Germán said, recounting a discussion in which the pitcher told him the comments "were not to be taken personal, more on a professional level."

Germán wants to be available to younger teammates for advice.

"I can talk to them in specific details on how you can find yourself in the best time of your professional career and how all of a sudden all can change from one night to the other," he said.

Germán said he learned "the biggest thing is about how do you react to certain things? How do you make certain decisions in your life when things are tough? I’m a public figure. I play with this team, this well-known organization throughout the world. How do I know how to behave in the best way possible to represent everybody here?"

"It was very smart to address to the team, just to get it out there, get it in the room and move forward from here," Stanton said. "It was definitely a big mistake he made, and he understands that. At the same time, it’s what are you doing to do with that mistake?"

Boone said Germán has been crisp in bullpens but can’t be compared with his 2019 form.

"A year-and-a-half ago when he was at the top of his game," Boone said. "There’s nothing that suggests he can’t get back to that point, to being that kind of player. But I would also caution that we’re very early in the game as far as him working his way back. But so far I’ve liked what I’ve seen."A front-runner "Plan B" option to direct the Office of Management and Budget has privately touted her ability to get confirmed by the Senate, even as she publicly supports the confirmation of her friend, President Biden’s controversial nominee Neera Tanden, according to a report.

Privately, O’Leary has not shied away from angling herself as Tanden’s replacement, touting herself as a skilled policy builder and a less-partisan alternative, three Democratic sources told Politico. O’Leary, a longtime Democratic operative, most recently served as chief of staff to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Two of the sources said O’Leary even told them she could be confirmed by the Senate.

Publicly, O’Leary has advocated for Tanden, whose chances at the top budget job are slim after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and a slew of Republican moderates said they’d vote against her, citing years of hostile and overtly partisan tweets. Privately, too, sources said she is still expressing support for Tanden and doesn’t seem to be openly campaigning for the position.

O’Leary and Tanden have a history together: The two worked side-by-side in a tight-knit "brain trust" policy advisory group.

NEERA TANDEN COMMITTEE VOTES ABRUPTLY DELAYED AS BIDEN BUDGET PICK'S NOMINATION IN JEOPARDY

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) and Budget Committees postponed planned business meetings Wednesday where they were supposed to vote on Tanden.

When reached by Politico, O’Leary reiterated support for Tanden. "Neera Tanden is exceptionally well-qualified and should be confirmed for this position," O’Leary said. "I have worked with her for years and years, and I can’t imagine a better advocate for President Biden to get his budget through Congress and help manage the policies of this administration. I am 1,000 percent behind her."

The White House has yet to acknowledge the slim chances their first nominee will be confirmed for the job. When pressed on if Biden was considering other options after two Senate committees postponed their votes, press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday: "There's one nominee to lead the budget department. Her name's Neera Tanden and that's who we are continuing to fight for."

"Neera Tanden is a leading policy expert who brings critical qualifications to the table during this time of unprecedented crisis," Psaki said earlier Wednesday. "She also has important perspective and values, understanding firsthand the powerful difference policy can make in the lives of those going through hard times. She has a broad spectrum of support, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to labor unions, and has a strong record of working with both parties that we expect to grow in President Biden's Cabinet as the first South Asian woman to lead OMB."

NEERA TANDEN OMB NOMINATION HANGING BY A THREAT AS DEMS LAUNCH 'FULL-SCALE EFFORT' TO FIND VOTES

Manchin said he would vote against Tanden because her mean tweets foreshadowed a "toxic and detrimental impact" on the relationship between Congress and the OMB.

"I have carefully reviewed Neera Tanden’s public statements and tweets that were personally directed towards my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from Senator Sanders to Senator McConnell and others," Manchin said. "I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget."

No other Republican has yet announced support for Tanden, and a number of moderates who have voted for all of Biden’s other nominees have said they will not vote for her.

Other names being floated to replace Tanden include Shalanda Young, Biden’s pick for deputy director of OMB, and Gene Sperling, an economic aide in the Clinton and Obama administrations.Diversity consultant Robin DiAngelo has distanced herself from a LinkedIn training seminar after its content – which urged employees to "be less white" – made headlines.

Slides from the seminar, "Confronting Racism," were leaked by a Coca-Cola employee and quickly spread on social media. The course featured DiAngelo, author of the bestselling 2018 book "White Fragility."

A statement posted on her website says DiAngelo was not the creator of the seminar, and was "unaware that her name, image, and work were being presented in this way and did not participate in or agree to the creation and distribution of an educational resource based on her research."

The statement clarified that the clips featuring DiAngelo had been taken from an interview the author did for the outlet Big Think in 2018 to promote "White Fragility."

It went on to say the clips had been re-edited and licensed by LinkedIn Learning as an anti-racism training resource for companies.

"(DiAngelo) did not provide the slides that were included with the video, and they do not represent the work she does for her virtual or in-person presentations, trainings, and workshops," the statement said.

After provoking outrage online, LinkedIn removed the course from its website. A spokesperson for the website told media outlets that the website provides a "wide variety of learning content, including more than 270 courses on the topics of diversity, inclusion and belonging."

"We will continue to add new courses to help people learn the skills they need to be more successful in their career, including the foundational skills we all need to be effective allies and help build a more equitable future."

"How the mighty have fallen," Rivera told Martha MacCallum on "The Story" Wednesday. "Just six months ago, Andrew Cuomo was the paragon of virtue, the man that steadied the entire nation during the pandemic with his well-publicized briefs, his book that came out. He had the only reputation that was salvageable in the midst of the pandemic. Now it seems everything has come to light that shows there's another side to Andrew Cuomo, allegedly."

Cuomo's office has denied Boylan's claims, with press secretary Caitlin Girouard calling them "simply false".

For his part, Murdock said that whether Cuomo committed sexual harassment or not, he is certainly guilty of "terrible leadership."

Responding to a poor attempt at humor Wednesday in which Cuomo stated he was a "certified vaccinator" who was able to select the part of the human anatomy in which to vaccinate, Murdock said, "It's a little hard to laugh at something like that when you're the person who is directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of some 15,000 seniors who died in nursing homes across New York state … That’s no laughing matter."

CUOMO BROTHERS CONTINUE TO EMBARRASS CNN

"A lot of people that want answers," Murdock added. "Rather than people fess up, take responsibility, explain what he did wrong and apologize, here we got him again laughing, telling jokes. It's just terrible, terrible leadership."

Throughout the pandemic, Cuomo was a frequent guest on CNN, often yucking it up with his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in friendly, comical interviews.

Seeking out the opinion of fellow Reddit users who are a part of a popular life advice thread for the "frustrated moral philosopher," the anonymous husband asked whether he was at fault for making his wife feel fat-shamed on their wedding anniversary.

The 25-year-old husband, who is going by the username ThrowawayExerciser, explained that he likes to "work out regularly" and "stick to a good diet." He described his 23-year-old wife as "very overweight," but he noted that he doesn’t mind and has made it a point to respect that his wife doesn’t want to a part of his fitness journey.

While they waited at the train station, they bumped into one of the husband’s gym friends, who just so happens to be a 24-year-old woman.

The husband claimed that he and his friend discussed their current diets and workout plans.

"My wife, who was unusually silent, excused herself to go to the toilet. Soon after, my friend finished talking and went on her way," ThrowawayExerciser wrote. "However, I noticed my wife was taking an unusually long time on the toilet. By the time the train arrived, she was still gone."

"I texted her, telling her that the train had arrived and asked her how much longer she would be. I didn't get any reply," he added. "I was about to call the police, when she finally texted back, saying she was at home."

After the husband made his way back home, he found out his wife had left because his conversation with his friend "made her very uncomfortable about her weight."

The husband admitted he felt angry that his wife had lied to him before she ditched their anniversary plans.

"I told her that what she did wasn't okay, but she wasn't having any of that. She got in the car and drove off to my parent's house," ThrowawayExerciser shared. "She then texted my entire family, telling them stuff like ‘I hated her because of her weight’ and stuff like that. They've been blowing up my phone, telling me what a jerk I am and that fat shaming isn't cool."

MAN ASKS REDDIT IF HE'S IN THE WRONG FOR OFFERING WOMAN A DRINK AT A BAR, THEN REFUSING TO PAY

Since sharing his experience in the 2.5 million-member thread on Monday, the husband’s post has generated more than 3,500 upvotes and 980 comments.

Most Reddit users who replied to the husband determined he wasn’t in the wrong and shouldn’t be called a "fat-shamer" if his telling of events are accurate.

"If she's just said you're fat shaming for [talking] with someone else about a common interest between you and [them], that she herself isn't interested in, that's her problem," the top commenter wrote, who received more than 7,800 upvotes. "She's the one bothered by her weight. In that case, she needs to do something about it and not get upset and storm off just because you do care about your fitness and talk to others about it who share the same interest."

"Her insecurity is her problem and should not justify this outrageously childish behavior," another highly-upvoted comment said. "If being fat actually mattered to OP, he wouldn't still be married to her."

"Unless you two were openly shaming and talking about fat people in front of her, I don't see how discussing diets and exercises is fat shaming," a different Reddit user commented.

MEGHAN MCCAIN CONTINUES TO BASH DR. FAUCI OVER ‘INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT AND CONFUSING’ CORONAVIRUS MESSAGING

But, if you follow the science, and think it’s always Dr. Fauci, you'll be chasing your tail like a Beagle with OCD. -- The man changes his story more often than a suspect on "Columbo."

Here are just a few examples. Let's review these flashbacks:

FAUCI ON "TODAY" / NBC FEBRUARY 29, 2020: Right now, at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you're doing on a day-by-day basis.

FAUCI ON MSNBC APRIL 12, 2020: As soon as it became clear that there was community spread… then it became clear that we were in real trouble.

SHARPTON: When was that?

FAUCI: That was probably towards the middle to end of January.

FAUCI on CBS NEWS, MARCH 8, 2020: Right now, in the United States, people should not be walking around with masks.

FAUCI ON PBS, APRIL 3, 2020: Putting a mask on yourself is more to prevent you from infecting someone else. And if everybody does that, we're each protecting each other.

FAUCI TO NEW YORK PRESS CLUB JANUARY 29, 2021: If one mask is good, two masks are better.

You could wear Fauci on the beach -- he's such a flip flop.

But it’s not his fault. Science changes and as we learn more, we don’t ignore new facts.

Unless you still think the Earth is flat, the dumbest lie ever told was that "the science is settled."

And Fauci's right to say what he thinks is right for that moment.

He's not blinded by science, just spotlights.

It’s when he looks backward and opinions replace prescriptions just to tickle the media.

Cuoco, who played Penny in the long-running sitcom, recently opened up to Variety about her time on "The Big Bang Theory" and how news of Parsons’ impending departure left her "in a state of shock."

"Jim said, ‘I don’t think I can continue on,’" Cuoco, 35, revealed. "And I was so shocked that I was literally like, ‘Continue on with what?’ Like, I didn’t even know what he was talking about. I looked at [show creator] Chuck [Lorre]: ‘Wow. I thought we were [filming season 13] — I’m so blown away right now.’"

At the start of filming season 12, Cuoco revealed a conversation she had with co-star Johnny Galecki about the prospect of filming a potential season 13: "'Did we want to do it?' And we really did."

Following Parsons’ revelation, Lorre stated, "We’re all for one, one for all. And we’re not going to do this without the whole team," according to Cuoco.

"That was the one thing we all agreed on — we came in together, we go out together," she added.

Following the end of "The Big Bang Theory," Cuoco has taken on a prominent role as lead star and executive producer for the HBO Max series, "The Flight Attendant."

In "The Flight Attendant," Cuoco plays Cassie Bowden, a heavy-drinking flight attendant who finds herself waking up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed with a dead man and no bearings about what happened.

Fox News’ Julius Young contributed to this reportEXCLUSIVE -- Radio legend Rush Limbaugh, who died last week at the age of 70 after a battle with lung cancer, will be honored at this weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and inducted into the Conservative Hall of Fame, Fox News has learned.

Limbaugh will become the first individual to be enshrined in the American Conservative Union’s Conservative Hall of Fame. The National Rifle Association was the inaugural inductee back in 2018.

Limbaugh will also be honored with a video tribute celebrating his life and career that will be shown on Saturday night during the event’s prestigious Ronald Reagan Dinner. Longtime "Rush Limbaugh Show" producer Bo Snerdley is expected to be in attendance, according to a source.

American Conservative Union (ACU) chairman Matt Schlapp remembered being "glued" to Limbaugh’s 2009 CPAC speech, which inspired the conservative movement and is widely considered one of the most important moments of his iconic career.

RUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO PIONEER, DEAD AT 70

Limbaugh, who rarely traveled to events and only spoke at one CPAC, offered an explanation of "who conservatives are" that caused the crowd to erupt with chants of "USA! USA!" Schlapp hoped Limbaugh would be able to return to speak at this year's event, but health did not allow that to happen.

"The fact that that speech stands alone as this very important moment for CPAC and for conservativism is somehow appropriate," Schlapp told Fox News.

"He told us what being a conservative is in his language that we got so used to. He told the country what motivates us, he captured [it] in that fly-over country, Midwestern language," Schlapp added. "I think a lot of people watched it again over the course of the last several days since his passing."

All the cable news networks took Limbaugh’s 2009 speech live, helping to put CPAC on the map outside of conservative circles. His remarks were considered a "Conservative State of the Union" and allowed liberal viewers who tuned in on mainstream media outlets to get a glimpse of the conservative movement.

"We love people. When we look out over the United States of America, when we are anywhere, when we see a group of people, such as this or anywhere, we see Americans," Limbaugh told the crowd. "We see human beings. We don't see groups. We don't see victims. We don't see people we want to exploit.

"What we see -- what we see is potential. We do not look out across the country and see the average American, the person that makes this country work, we do not see that person with contempt. We don't think that person doesn't have what it takes. We believe that person can be the best he or she wants to be if certain things are just removed from their path like onerous taxes, regulations and too much government."

"We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be. We recognize that we are all individuals. We love and revere our founding documents, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence," he continued. "We believe that the preamble to the Constitution contains an inarguable truth that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness."

The automaker says it will "unpause" the streaming versions of its Super Bowl LV commercial starring Bruce Springsteen after DUI and reckless driving charges against the singer were dropped on Wednesday.

Just days after the two-minute ad ran during the game, it came to light that Springsteen had been arrested in November in a national park in New Jersey when he was spotted getting on to his motorcycle after drinking tequila.

Jeep pulled the spot from social media, saying it would "pause our Big Game commercial until the actual facts can be established"

Springsteen pleaded guilty to one count of drinking in a closed area during the online hearing, but prosecutors proposed the dismissal of the DUI and reckless driving charges based on the fact that Springsteen's blood-alcohol level was just .02, well below the local limit of .08, and the judge agreed.

"As we stated previously, we paused the commercial until the facts were established. Now, that the matter has been resolved, we are unpausing the film," a Jeep spokesperson told Fox News after the verdict.

The judge ordered Springsteen to pay a $500 fine and $40 in court fees.

"I think I can pay that immediately, your Honor," Springsteen responded.

Springsteen had never removed the commercial from his own Twitter account.

The 49-year-old actor and comedian told Entertainment Tonight that he felt it was "too dangerous" to continue playing the character.

"It got too dangerous," Baron Cohen said of shooting the movies. "There were a couple of times I had to put on a bulletproof vest to go and shoot a scene, and you don't want to do that too many times in your life. I was pretty lucky to get out this time, so no, I'm not doing it again. I'm going to stay with the scripted stuff."

Baron Cohen first portrayed the fictional journalist from Kazakhstan in 2006's "Borat" for which he won a Golden Globe award.

"The night before something like that — that rally — you're trying to go through everything that can go wrong," he recalled "In a normal scene like what we're doing, we're trying to make sure, 'How do I make sure my performance is real? Have I done my research? How do I make sure the accent's perfect?' In this one you're going, 'Okay, if a bunch of guys with guns come from that side of the stage, have I got a way to get out? What happens if someone shoots me? What if a bunch of people start shooting me?'"

He was wearing a bulletproof vest for the scene and revealed the production team made "an amplifier that was basically bomb proof" for him to hide in, just in case.

FOX 5 DC reporter Bob Barnard was reporting live on icy weather and road conditions in northern Virginia last Friday morning when a heart-warming puppy ran out into the street to greet him.

"I don’t see an owner," Barnard says as he leans down to scoop up the runaway pup.

"I’ll keep an eye on her," he said, waving to someone off camera as the friendly pup licked the side of his face.

Someone came out of a nearby home and explained that the puppy – whose name is Pierogi – had "jumped right through the gate."

She then explained that she had wanted to get the tattoo "for a couple of years."

"It basically means like, you know, being true to yourself and real and like not pretending to be something you’re not," she explained, adding that she finally got the tattoo on March 4, 2020 – just days before the coronavirus hit the U.S.

The comments came after House lawmakers re-introduced the bill. It was first unveiled last June when nationwide protests were ascendant after the police custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

"Today, by re-introducing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the House is again joining the American people to turn this moment of agony into one of action, as we honor George Floyd’s life and the lives of all killed by police brutality," Pelosi said in a statement.

The bill, Pelosi said, will address "systemic racism, curb police brutality and save lives." It also bans chokeholds, stops no-knock warrants, combats racial profiling, and establishes new protections to prevent and combat police misconduct.

Pelosi said that despite last year’s protests that brought renewed calls for criminal justice reform, "police brutality continues." She said there were more police killings in 2020 than in 2019, with minority groups "bearing the brunt of this cruelty."

"Working with the Biden-Harris Administration and the millions of Americans marching and demanding action, we will not stop working until this legislation becomes law," Pelosi said.

The comments as several witnesses have been subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is already facing state murder charges in Floyd’s death.

The Justice Department's federal civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, according to a person who spoke to The Associated Press.

Jury selection begins in Chavin's state case on March 8 — he faces second-degree murder and manslaughter charges — with opening statements scheduled for March 29.

The increased federal grand jury activity in connection with Floyd's death comes as the Justice Department, under President Joe Biden, is expected to focus more on civil rights issues, criminal justice overhauls and policing policies in the wake of nationwide protests over the death of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.NBC pulled an episode of "Nurses" from its digital platforms after the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called on the network to take action over a scene that has been widely condemned for the way it portrayed a Hasidic patient who refused a bone graft from "goyim," an Arab or a woman.

The scene in question appeared on a Feb. 9 episode of "Nurses" -- which aired its final episode Tuesday night -- and featured a Hasidic Jewish patient who needed a bone graft from a deceased donor who overcomes a significant injury when his father chimed in, "A goyim leg. From anyone. An Arab, a woman?" Goyim is the Yiddish word for gentiles.

"The portrayal of a Hasidic Jew making hateful remarks about ‘an Arab, a woman’ is gratuitous and inflammatory, and only validates longstanding antisemitic stereotypes. Additionally, the episode’s entire premise is wrong," ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told Fox News Wednesday.

"Unfortunately, myths about Jewish religious beliefs and practices are far too commonplace, and this episode only serves to amplify such longstanding misperceptions about Jews. We have reached out to NBC executives and have requested that they pull the episode and review their standards for approving dramatic content so that this doesn’t happen in the future," his statement read.

Greenblatt added that in Jewish law, "anything that is potentially lifesaving or health-preserving is not only permitted but indeed mandated."

NBC UNDER FIRE FOR 'ANTI-SEMITIC' SCENE IN 'NURSES' ON HEELS OF WIDELY CONDEMNED 'SNL' JOKE

Global Jewish human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told us in a statement that in just "one scene," the peacock network "insulted and demonized religious Jews and Judaism.

"The writers of this scene check all the boxes of ignorance and pernicious negative stereotypes, right down to the name of the patient, Israel—paiyous (sidelocks) and all," the organization said.

"Overreaction? Orthodox Jews are targeted for violent hate crimes - in the city of New York, Jews are [the] number one target of hate crimes in [the] US; this is no slip of the tongue. It was a vile, cheap attack masquerading as TV drama," the statement continued. "What’s NBC going to do about it?"

"Nurses," filmed and set in Toronto, is a Canadian medical drama that was acquired by NBC in 2020. The show follows five young nurses working at a busy downtown hospital.

The Anti-Defamation League went even further to say that they have been monitoring "Weekend Update" this season and said the segment has "inappropriately use[d] Jews as the punchline" multiple times.

"Unfortunately, ADL has tracked multiple 'Weekend Update' jokes this season that inappropriately use Jews as the punchline. I know they can do better," Greenblatt told Fox News Monday evening.

They have not returned requests for comment regarding the ADL's call for action.Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declined Wednesday to directly respond to criticism levied by his former press secretary Karen Hinton, who wrote in a scathing op-ed accusing de Blasio of problematic behavior toward female staffers, instead emphasizing the role of women in his administration.

Hinton, who has worked as an aide to both and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo during her career, criticized both Democratic leaders in a New York Daily News column entitled "How to counter penis politics." In the column, Hinton said de Blasio maintained a "hectoring, inflexible approach that bordered on sanctimony" and created a work environment that left "female staffers feeling especially marginalized."

CUOMO AIDE DENIES LINDSEY BOYLAN CLAIM THAT GOVERNOR ASKED HER TO PLAY STRIP POKER

"Although the mayor preached a philosophy of egalitarianism, the workplace was pretty much like any other male-dominated environment I’ve been in: Women were interrupted more often and listened to less, whether they were a commissioner or a scheduler," Hinton wrote. "By the end of his first term, the mayor had lost twice as many senior officials who were women than men."

The column was published amid an ongoing spat between Cuomo and de Blasio, frequent rivals who have traded barbs throughout the coronavirus pandemic. When New York Assemblyman Ron Kim accused Cuomo of threatening to destroy his reputation over his criticism of the state’s nursing home scandal, de Blasio remarked that Cuomo’s "bullying is nothing new."

When asked about Hinton’s criticism of his own behavior since becoming mayor, de Blasio declined to directly respond to her column. Instead, he touted his close work with top female aides in shaping city policy both before and during the pandemic.

De Blasio also referenced his close relationship with his wife, Chirlane.

"I have not seen the piece. I’ll only talk about the history of this administration," de Blasio said. "From the beginning, literally from the very beginning, the leadership of this administration has been majority women and continues to be. My number one adviser, confidant, partner in everything, everyone knows, is Chirlane. My longest-serving aide, the person I have depended on and worked so closely with now for a decade or more, Emma Wolf, and four out of six deputy mayors are women."

"Throughout this administration, it’s been a female-led administration in so many ways, and I have tremendous respect for the folks who have been a part of this team," de Blasio added. "I listen to their voices and we make decisions. These are really, really tough issues, but we all work together, we all have real conversations together to get to a result. That’s been especially true during this crisis."

De Blasio’s office did not return a request for further comment.

Hinton also took Cuomo to task for his demeanor, describing the governor as a "master of the art" of political bullying she described as "penis politics." She wrote that Cuomo undermined her work, demanded 24-hour attention and attempted to block other career opportunities from coming to fruition.

Cuomo’s office did not return a request for comment.

"While they had different styles, both Cuomo and de Blasio had one thing in common," Hinton wrote. "Like many powerful men in politics, they create a public image as champions of women’s rights and equality. Behind closed doors, they use gender domination as one means to assert their power over women."

In a separate column published Wednesday, former Cuomo aide Lindsey Boylan accused the governor of engaging in a pattern of sexual harassment and unwanted advances. In one instance, she claimed the governor asked her to play "strip poker" during a flight.

Cuomo’s office denied he engaged in any wrongdoing, describing Boylan’s allegations as "quite simply false."Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., has reintroduced legislation to remove a statue commemorating emancipation, arguing that 19th-century memorial doesn't do enough to honor slaves' contribution to their own freedom.

Dedicated in 1876, the statue shows former President Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation, with his hand outstretched over a shackled slave who is kneeling beside him. It was erected after a freed slave, Charlotte Scott, started a fundraising campaign that collected funds from freed slaves.

"Although formerly enslaved Americans paid for this statue, the design and sculpting process was done without their input or participation in any way, and it shows," Holmes Norton said in a press release last week.

"The statue fails to note how enslaved African Americans pressed for their own emancipation. Understandably, they were only recently liberated from slavery and were grateful for any recognition of their freedom. However, in his keynote address at the unveiling of the statue, Frederick Douglass pointedly did not praise the statue, and, indeed, in private remarks, went as far as to say, 'it showed the negro on his knee when a more manly attitude would have been indicative of freedom.'"

STATUE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN WITH KNEELING SLAVE REMOVED FROM BOSTON

The congresswoman introduced the legislation last year amid a wave of racially charged demonstrations that sometimes included toppling monuments. A copy of the statue was removed from Boston last year.

According to Smithsonian Magazine, the famed abolitionist Fredrick Douglass sought to place another monument in addition to the one with Lincoln and the kneeling slave.

He was reportedly uncomfortable with the statue's depiction. During his address dedicating the statue, he stated that Lincoln "was preeminently the white man’s President, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men."

In a letter to the editor of the National Republican newspaper, Douglass said: "The mere act of breaking the negro's chains was the act of Abraham Lincoln, and it is beautifully expressed in this monument. But the act by which the negro was made a citizen of the United States and invested with the elective franchise was pre-eminently the act of President U.S. Grant, and this is nowhere seen in the Lincoln monument."

Marcia Cole, who portrays Scott in Female Re-enactors of Distinction, reportedly opposed the statues' removal last year.

"What he’s [freed slave] symbolizing to me and others is that he’s indicating his previous position of servitude, but he’s rising out of that," Cole said, according to WUSA9.

"No offense but this sounds like you’re high on your own supply," Tanden tweeted to the Alaska Republican in 2017, after Murkowski tweeted support for the 2017 tax cuts. "You know, we know, and everyone knows this is all garbage. Just stop."

"High on my own supply, that's interesting should I ask her? My own supply of what?" Murkowski said as Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim showed her the tweet.

"See that goes to show how much homework I still have to do on her if I didn't even know that she had sent out a tweet about me," Murkowski said.

Asked if the tweet affected her view of Tanden, Murkowski replied: "I was trying to look at competence, but apparently I'm going to have to do more looking into what she thinks about me.

"You know, I suggested to the White House that my colleagues were being very critical of the statements, and rightly so, I think some of them were clearly over the top. It seems that in this world, we've kind of gotten numb to derogatory tweets. I don't think that that is, that's a model that we want to set for anybody, whether it's a nominee, whether it's a president, or whether it's a senator — so I'd like us all to cool that," she continued.

Murkowski said the White House had offered to make Tanden available for a sit-down.

Confirmation prospects for Tanden, President Biden’s embattled OMB nominee, are hanging by a thread due to her record of divisive remarks after Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced he would not vote to confirm Tanden, a longtime Democrat policy advisor and president of the Center for American Progress.

POTENTIAL TANDEN REPLACEMENT REPORTEDLY TOUTS HERSELF AS LESS-PARTISAN ALTERNATIVE

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) and Budget Committees postponed planned business meetings Wednesday where they were supposed to vote on Tanden, throwing her confirmation further into doubt by the cancellation of the two committee votes.

Without Manchin’s vote, the White House would need to court at least one Republican vote to push through Tanden. Sens. Susan Collins, Maine, Mitt Romney, Utah, Rob Portman, Ohio, and Shelley Capito, W.Va., have all signaled to the White House to look elsewhere. Murkowski is the only Republican to leave the door open on Tanden.

Even if Murkowski did agree to vote for Tanden, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have not yet said how they’ll vote. Sinema is known for bucking her party on some matters, and Sanders was a frequent punching bag for Tanden when she worked as a policy adviser for Hillary Clinton.CNN appears to be giving cover to Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo by not covering sexual harassment allegations leveled against him by former administration aide Lindsey Boylan.

Boylan, the former deputy secretary for economic development and a special adviser to Cuomo, published a bombshell essay Wednesday on the website Medium. She accused the governor of going "out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs," forcibly kissing her on the lips during a one-on-one briefing, and suggesting that they "play strip poker" during a plane ride.

Cuomo's office denied Boylan's harassment claims, calling them "simply false" and insisting the strip poker comment "did not happen."

Eight hours after Boylan came forward with her claims, CNN, the home network of the governor's brother Chris Cuomo, has made zero mention of the allegations on its air or on CNN.com, according to Grabian transcripts and search results on the network's website.

GOV. CUOMO ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY FORMER AIDE

MSNBC has similarly skipped coverage of the sexual harassment allegations facing the already-embattled Democrat.

MSNBC, however, did offer brief coverage of Cuomo's ongoing nursing home scandal, reporting on a new Marist poll that showed 61% of New York voters believe Cuomo did something wrong with his handling of the state's nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.

Neither CNN nor MSNBC responded to Fox News' requests for comment.

MEGHAN MCCAIN TORCHES CHRIS CUOMO AND 'GHOUL OF A BROTHER' FOR CNN 'COMEDY SHOWS' AMID NURSING HOME SCANDAL

CNN, along with "Cuomo Prime Time" anchor Chris Cuomo, have made an unprecedented push to downplay and deflect from the controversies surrounding the New York Democrat, with the far-left network giving developments in the nursing home scandal little to no airtime -- while giving the governor's anchor brother free rein to conduct friendly, comical interviews with the scandal-plagued governor in the early months of the pandemic.

While the governor is now facing allegations of sexual harassment and bullying from Boylan, the CNN anchor once gushed in an interview from May that his brother was "single and ready to mingle."

Earlier this month, CNN said Chris Cuomo was barred from covering his brother and admitted network brass lifted the "rule" last year for the host to conduct his chummy fraternal interviews.

Gov. Cuomo's administration is reportedly under investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn after critics accused officials of covering up the true number of COVID nursing home deaths in the state. Early in the pandemic, the governor ordered assisted living facilities to accept COVID-positive patients in order to keep hospital beds free.President Biden's State Department announced Wednesday the creation of a new diversity officer position along with a council of deputy assistant secretaries from each of its bureaus devoted to the issue.

"I am committed to bringing the diversity and inclusion work already underway at the State Department to the next level," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Wednesday. "To make that happen, I am pleased to announce the creation of a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer position at State."

The new officer will ‘hold senior leadership accountable’ for implementing new diversity and inclusion programs and report directly to Blinken, he said.

TRUMP ENDS 'CRITICAL RACE THEORY' TRAINING FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, CALLS IT A 'SICKNESS'

"Our diversity gives us a significant competitive advantage on the world stage," he said. "This is something that the President, the Vice President, and I firmly believe."

Each State Department bureau has been asked to designate one of its deputy assistant secretaries to oversee their respective diversity and inclusion efforts.

"Each one of us has the power and the opportunity to help create a stronger, fairer workplace, where everyone can contribute their talents and ideas and everyone is treated with dignity and respect," Blinken said. "That’s what this work is all about, and why we’re making it an early priority."

The State Department had reinstated diversity training in late January, after the Trump administration shut down "critical race theory" training in September 2020.

The former administration had criticized programs that suggested the U.S. is an "inherently racist or evil country" as "divisive, anti-American propaganda" and a waste of taxpayers’ money.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment.Carly Pearce is reflecting on her 2020 divorce from Michael Ray.

The country music songstress, 30, recently opened up about her divorce from now ex-husband, singer Michael Ray, after just eight months of marriage.

"It was awful. I mean, I’m being completely honest with you, that it was so embarrassing. It was so shameful," Pearce told Us Weekly on Tuesday. "I felt like I had failed. I felt like… I would never find love again because I was divorced at so young, and [I] was just embarrassed."

Pearce then recalled being with fellow artist Kelsea Ballerini before going public with the split and revealed how the "Peter Pan" singer gave her the courage to tell the world her story.

COUNTRY SINGERS CARLY PEARCE AND MICHAEL RAY DIVORCING AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR OF MARRIAGE

"She goes, ‘Do you realize that you could help put a face to something that people think is so bad? But yet, you’re showing them that they can get through it too,’" the "Every Little Thing" singer recalled. "I remember just feeling, like, ‘Wow, OK. If I can get to a place where I feel like that’ — and I really do feel that way now. I have these connections with people in the middle of a pandemic where I feel closer to country music fans than ever."

Pearce then advised listeners to have faith throughout their struggles and to always "trust God."

"Trust God, trust the process and use each experience — whether it’s good or bad — as a place of refining you instead of defining you," she added.

Pearce and Ray, 32, confirmed their relationship in a July 2018 Instagram post and quickly became engaged five months later. The couple wed in October 2019 before ultimately splitting in June 2020. The divorce was finalized in September 2020.Annika Sorenstam smiled and began shaking her head before she heard the rest of the question, already aware what others might think about one of the LPGA Tour's most dominant players returning to competition after 12 years.

She is among the 120 players in the field this week for the Gainbridge LPGA.

Next week she goes back to being a wife, mother and businesswoman.

"This is not a comeback. It's an appearance. And I'm just thrilled about that," Sorenstam said Wednesday at Lake Nona, her home course for 21 years and a big reason she decided to play for the first time since she retired in 2008.

Her appearance is no less amazing.

Sorenstam turned 50 in October. She announced her retirement when she was 37 and was coming off consecutive victories of what turned out to be the last of her 72 victories on the LPGA Tour.

Her youngest child, 9-year-old Will, has the golf bug and that brings Sorenstam out to the course more often. She has played with her father in the PNC Championship the last two years. Diamond Resorts supports her foundation, so she played in the celebrity division of the LPGA Tour season opener last month.

And then the Gainbridge LPGA moved from south Florida to Lake Nona, and Sorenstam already was contemplating a return to competition at the U.S. Senior Women's Open.

"I figured I just need some tournament rounds," she said. "I need some experience back inside the ropes and focusing on 18 holes, making putts, no mulligans and no gimmes."

It's a treat for players who only know Sorenstam for her Hall of Fame career. She has the career Grand Slam, and she became known on a first-name basis in golf when she boldly tried to compete against the men in 2003 at Colonial, the first woman in 45 years to play on the PGA Tour.

Some 40 players in the field know her for the Annika Foundation that supports amateur golf around the world. They all played her tournaments, and now they get to compete against her, at least for one week.

One of them is Gabriela Ruffels, the former U.S. Women's Amateur champion who played in the Annika Intercollegiate when she was at Southern California.

"She's the greatest of all time, and it's really cool to see her walking around," Ruffels said. "I saw her on the range a couple days ago. I was kind of star-struck, to be honest."

Sorenstam knows better than to have expectations, high or low. No matter how much she's been practicing in recent weeks for this appearance, she cannot simply flip the switch. She had a swing that was as repeatable as any, with that famous early head turn, that it came from relentless work when golf was her priority.

Gone is the hunger to win.

"Shooting around par I think will be a good thing for me," said Sorenstam, the only player to shoot 59 on the LPGA. "I'm going to obviously do the best I can. I think the biggest difference nowadays is I’m just not as consistent as I was. Nowadays I'm good for 14 holes, and I don't know what's coming the other four. It's a little more surprise on the course."

She has a house on near the 16th tee at Lake Nona, and Sorenstam jokes that it's the only part of the course she knows. The members at Lake Nona mostly see her at pickleball or in the clubhouse for Easter brunch or a Thanksgiving feast.

Now it's about golf at the highest level. Lake Nona, home to several PGA and LPGA players, hosted the Solheim Cup in 1990 and previously had the Tavistock Cup, matches between tour members from Lake Nona and Isleworth.

But it's only one week.

"If it wasn't Lake Nona, I wouldn't be here," she said. "I'm in a different place in my life. The LPGA has been a huge part in my life, in my hear heart and wonderful memories. But that's not why I'm here, to create more."

Even so, she takes her golf seriously with a scorecard in hand.

Sorenstam did not say how she would prepare for the U.S. Senior Women's Open in July. That right around the time of the Olympics, and Sorenstam recently was appointed to a ceremonial role of president of the International Golf Federation, which overseas Olympic golf. She said the executive director of IGF, Antony Scanlon, was in favor of her playing.American League MVP José Abreu tested positive for COVID-19 and will spend a few days away from the Chicago White Sox, while Cardinals reliever Andrew Miller told a St. Louis newspaper he tested positive 10 days before reporting to camp.

White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said Wednesday in a statement that Abreu is "completely asymptomatic." Hahn said testing also showed the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, and the Cuban slugger believes he had a mild case of the virus in January.

"Other than being frustrated, José feels great and, like the rest of us, is looking forward to when he rejoins the club in the not too distant future," Hahn said.

Manager Tony La Russa said Abreu will likely join the team by Monday and perhaps as soon as Friday.

"He’s rarin’ to go," La Russa said. "I’ll say this. When he walks in the door, it’s going to be a huge moment for the 2021 White Sox. The guys can’t wait to see him, and he can’t wait to see them."

Abreu helped the White Sox return to the playoffs for the first time since 2008. The three-time All-Star hit .317 with 19 home runs and a major league-leading 60 RBIs in the pandemic-shortened season. He joined Nellie Fox (1959), Dick Allen (1972) and Frank Thomas (1993, 1994) as the team’s only MVP winners.

Miller, meanwhile, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the only symptom he had was losing his sense of smell for a while and that he spent a week-plus quarantined in the guest room of his house.

Miller said he feels all right now and that no one in his family was affected.

"I think I got really lucky," Miller said. "I don’t know how I got it. I don’t believe I passed it along to anybody in my family. My contacts were very limited but it sounds like everybody got through and I’m the only one I know that got it. I’m glad to get a clean bill of health.

"I do have some very minor fatigue, basically from being shut down. As much I would prefer not to have been infected with COVID, it’s over and done with and, in a sense, maybe one less thing to worry about since it appears I’ve come through the other side pretty good," he said.

Miller, 35, said he’s going to pace himself.

Miller was 1-1 with a 2.77 ERA in and four saves in 16 appearances in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. He made one appearance in the Cardinals’ wild-card series loss to the San Diego Padres.

In the first batch of results disclosed by the league last Friday, 13 positive tests were found among 4,336 samples.

GERMÁN'S APOLOGY

Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán gave a public apology for actions that led to a lengthy suspension under Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy, a day after he spoke with New York teammates and admitted he had engaged in dangerous conduct.

Speaking softly and dabbing his eyes at times, Germán said through a translator he wanted "to sincerely apologize to the Steinbrenner family, my teammates, the front office and those around me who love me. I have made mistakes of which I’m not proud of."

The 28-year-old has been welcomed by teammates but also faced wariness as he attempts to regain a place in the starting rotation.

"He messed up in life," first baseman Luke Voit said. "I don’t know the things he did. You always get a second chance at this. We have his back. But he’s skating on thin ice, and he needs to get his life together. And I think he’s doing the right steps to do so. But, again, he’s got to prove to us that he can do that."

Germán was placed on administrative leave on Sept. 19, 2019 while MLB investigated an alleged domestic violence incident involving his girlfriend, with whom he has at least one child.

SCHERZER’S SESSION

Max Scherzer held his first extended bullpen session off a mound Wednesday after being held back in spring training because of an injured left ankle, throwing 40 pitches at "about 80-85%," according to Washington Nationals manager Dave Martinez.

"No complaints. No issues," Martinez said. "We’ll see how he feels tomorrow, go from there."

Martinez said Scherzer’s ankle "didn’t bother him at all."

The three-time Cy Young Award winner hurt himself while running a couple of weeks before Washington’s camp opened in West Palm Beach, Florida.

ROBERT IMPRESSES

La Russa says AL Rookie of the Year runner-up Luis Robert is so talented he’s a "six-tool player." Actually, credit for that description goes to Hall of Famer Frank Thomas.

"I saw Frank Thomas this offseason, and he told me, ‘You’ve heard of a five-tool player?’ I said, ‘Sure.’ He says, ‘Luis is a six-tool player.’

"I’m watching him," La Russa added. "I can see. He’s got another gear or a level that he goes to."

Robert made a big impression last season with 11 home runs and 31 RBIs during the pandemic-shortened season. The center fielder from Cuba won a Gold Glove and finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting behind Seattle’s Kyle Lewis.

ARIHARA’S DEBUT

Kohei Arihara is still adjusting to the slicker MLB baseball and the dry climate in Arizona spring training after the past six seasons pitching in Japan’s Pacific League. The new Texas Rangers right-hander, signed to a $6.2 million, two-year contract in December, has now had his first taste of facing some big league hitters, and it was a good start for him.

Arihara said he threw 23 pitches during a live BP session Wednesday. The 28-year-old pitcher threw a variety of pitches, including a few high fastballs for strikes.

"It was a fresh feeling, like the start of a new year, so it felt good," Arihara said through his translator after the session on a backfield in Surprise, Arizona.

FANS IN THE STANDS

The San Diego Padres, who ended a 13-year playoff drought in 2020, will play their spring debut Sunday against Seattle in front of a few thousand fans at Peoria Stadium. It will be the first time since last spring training that they played in front of fans.

"That was something that was talked about a lot last year, was how electric Petco Park would be if there were fans last year during the course of the Slam Diego run, the winning streaks and the playoff berth and all that stuff," first baseman Eric Hosmer said.

"I think if there’s any team that’s excited to see some fans, it’s definitely us."A report alleging John Kerry may have colluded with Iran when meeting with its foreign minister during the Trump administration is drawing comparisons to the situation of retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to giving false statements to the FBI that included statements regarding his communications with a Russian ambassador.

Gen. Jack Keane, a retired four-star general and Fox News senior strategic analyst, told Fox News that the two instances deal with different issues but he can see why some would draw a correlation.

JOHN KERRY 'COLLUDED' WITH IRAN TO UNDERMINE TRUMP, REPORT SAYS

"In terms of what Secretary Kerry was doing and other members of the Biden administration, in my judgment is appalling and it’s reckless and significantly irresponsible," Keane said in an interview.

"What we’re not used to is previous government officials actually colluding and talking to our enemies, and I emphasize enemy because that is who Iran really is. In the past 40 years, there is no nation-state that has killed more Americans than Iran," he said.

Keane said there is a "considerable difference" between Flynn's and Kerry's situations, adding that "Gen. Flynn, as the incoming national security advisor, certainly talking to the Russian ambassador is part of his responsibility… which is normal protocol."

Biden administration officials, including John Kerry and Robert Malley, had meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during the Trump administration that were orchestrated to undermine President Biden's predecessor, a recent report from The Washington Times claims. Kerry has been open about the fact that he met with Zarif at least twice during the Trump administration, prompting Trump to say he should be prosecuted under the Logan Act because of the meetings.

The Logan Act bars private citizens from engaging with foreign nations in unauthorized talks that undermine U.S. foreign policy.

Zarif held meetings with Obama administration veterans who could return to power "to devise a political strategy to undermine the Trump administration" and usher in softer diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran, according to an unnamed former senior U.S. official cited by The Washington Times.

Kerry is now Biden's climate envoy, and Malley, who was part of creating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities, is Biden's Iran envoy.

POMPEO, OTHER CRITICS PAN BIDEN WH OFFER TO RESTART IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS

A judge dismissed the criminal case against Flynn in December. Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador included Russia's response to U.S. sanctions and a UN security council resolution regarding Israel. Flynn also admitted to filing paperwork under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that contained misrepresentations regarding business with Turkey. His sentencing was delayed due to his cooperation with prosecutors.

In 2019, Flynn began to claim innocence in the case, citing alleged FBI misconduct. FBI records were produced that called their interview into question, including handwritten notes that indicated an internal question as to whether the interview was meant to extract truth from Flynn or to get him to lie so authorities could pressure him with prosecution or termination.

"What was not routine is that Gen. Flynn was investigated, the investigators recommended to close the case based on no evidence of wrongdoing, but the top FBI leadership kept it open," Keane said.

What Kerry and other Democrats spoke about with Zarif is unknown. However, the Washington Times reported that while former President Donald Trump's attempts to set up a back channel with Iranian officials, meant to defuse tensions, fizzled, Democrats like Malley were meeting with Zarif.

"We don’t know exactly why he rejected it, but we can speculate that Malley, who’s now a part of the Biden team, was possibly telling Zarif that he should wait out the Trump administration and get a better deal," Keane said.

A group of three female runners sued state and local education officials after losing state titles to transgender athletes in 2018. Backers of the lawsuit contend that athletes who were born male have a natural and unfair advantage over competitors who were born female.

Supporters of the transgender athletes in the case argue that once hormone therapies take effect, the male genetic advantage fades away – although those effects aren’t immediate, and many teens don’t begin taking such drugs until after puberty.

BIDEN'S POLITICAL CORRECTNESS COULD THREATEN WOMEN'S SPORTS: NYPOST COLUMNIST

"The gender identity doesn't matter, it's the testosterone levels," Joanna Harper, a medical physicist who is also a transgender runner herself, told the Associated Press in 2019. "Trans girls should have the right to compete in sports. But cisgender girls should have the right to compete and succeed, too. How do you balance that? That's the question."

The Department of Justice became involved in the case under former President Donald Trump, with former Attorney General Bill Barr filing a statement of interest in March 2020.

"The government has reconsidered the matter and hereby notifies the Court that it withdraws its Statement of Interest," the DOJ said, according to court documents filed Tuesday.

The Justice Department’s decision to back out of the case comes ahead of a Friday hearing on a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.

Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to take part in sports without regulation. Some states place restrictions on transgender competitors, and others handle cases on an individual basis.

Booker received his second straight All-Star selection, both as an injury replacement. He's averaging 24.7 points, 4.3 assists, 3.8 rebounds and shooting a career-high 50.1% from the field.

Booker and fellow All-Star Chris Paul have helped Phoenix to a 20-10 record, fourth-best in the NBA.

And like many others across the league, Irving wants to see change when it comes to the NBA logo.

Even though West is considered to be the NBA’s logo, the league never admitted that it featured a specific player. Sources familiar with the league told Yahoo Sports that there is no interest in having an individual player as its logo because there are so many who have been instrumental in the growth of the NBA.

Sources also told Yahoo Sports in January that the NBA has never expressed any interest in moving forward with change, despite more than 3 million people signing a Change.org petition asking the league to make Bryant the new logo.Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice urged Senate Republicans Wednesday to "swallow" the hefty price tag of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, warning lawmakers that "you will leave a lot of people hurting" if they continue to oppose the legislation.

Justice responded on "Special Report" after Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, dismissed Biden's proposal as a "clunker" full of Democratic pet projects and unrelated items.

"I've got all the respect in the world for a good senator ... [and] you've got to understand, I am not an advocate of the projects, I can't stand those," Justice told host Bret Baier.

"But," he added, "in this whole situation, we are going to have to be able to stomach something to get everything across the finish line."

ROMEY CALLS BIDEN COVID RELIEF BILL A 'CLUNKER'

Romney is one of several Republican lawmakers who have criticized the provisions outlined in the relief bill. Among them are a $1,400 stimulus checks going to mixed-status families with undocumented immigrants; permission for Planned Parenthood to receive Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds designed to keep small businesses afloat; and nearly $600 million allocated for additional emergency paid family leave for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted that the Senate would pass the bill before March 14, but Biden could face serious challenges in his attempt to gain Republican support for his proposal, especially with a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage requirement and debate over how much money to funnel to struggling state and local governments.

Justice said he hopes Republicans will come around to the idea even if "we happen to just throw away a few dollars" in order to "really jump-start our economy and take care of all the people that are out there hurting.

"Let's go big enough that we can get there," he said. "We don't need to throw money away just to be throwing money away. But we've got to go big enough to make it happen."

The West Virginia governor also touted his state's coronavirus vaccine distribution program, which ranks among the most effective in the country. Justice said that 100% of doses received by the state have been administered or assigned to be administered.

"This was not rocket science and it is still not rocket science," he said of the state's vaccine rollout.

"Our model is real simple ... our local pharmacies, all of our local clinics, our National Guard stepped up and we took off," Justice explained.

"We looked at it as age, age, and age," Justice said, " and that's all there is to this."

Fox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report.The White House is reportedly set to discuss carbon emissions reductions with airline CEOs even as it remains silent on the use of a private jet by top climate change adviser John Kerry.

According to Reuters, White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy and economic adviser Brian Deese will have a virtual meeting Friday with the heads of four airlines -- American, United, Delta, and Southwest.

It comes as the airlines reportedly lobbied the Biden administration to increase subsidies for low carbon fuel in order to combat climate change.

The Air Transport Action Group has said that air travel contributes just around 2% of global emissions. Private jet travel has come under greater scrutiny amid the climate debate, as elites create a much larger carbon footprint per capita than others who take commercial flights.

JOHN KERRY TOOK PRIVATE JET TO ICELAND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARD, CALLED IT 'ONLY CHOICE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME'

Private jets have been estimated to emit upward of 40 times as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights. Fox News previously reported that Kerry's family jet racked up an estimated 116 metric tons of carbon emissions over the past year.

In 2019, Kerry took a private jet to receive the Arctic Circle award for climate leadership and was questioned on the apparent hypocrisy.

Icelandic reporter Jóhann Bjarni Kolbeinsson confronted Kerry at the event over his choice of transportation, asking: "I understand that you came here with a private jet. Is that an environmental way to travel?"

Kerry defended his high-pollution ride at the time, calling it "the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle" in an interview obtained by Fox News.

He added: "If you offset your carbon -- it's the only choice for somebody like me who is traveling the world to win this battle."

JOHN KERRY FAMILY PRIVATE JET EMITTED 116 METRIC TONS OF CARBON OVER PAST YEAR

"I negotiated the Paris Accords for the United States," he said, referring to the multilateral climate agreement signed while he was secretary of state under Barack Obama.

"I've been involved with this fight for years. I negotiated with [Chinese] President Xi to bring President Xi to the table so we could get Paris. And, I believe, the time it takes me to get somewhere, I can't sail across the ocean. I have to fly, meet with people and get things done."

It's unclear how Kerry has been offsetting his carbon output, as he claimed, but flight logs indicated that his family's private jet spent over 20 hours in the air over the past year -- culminating in an estimated 116 metric tons of carbon emissions.

For comparison, a March 2018 report from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. That calculation assumed a car that drives around 11,500 miles per year with a fuel economy of about 22.0 miles per gallon.Kelly Clarkson has received advice on divorce from First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.

Clarkson is in the middle of a divorce from Brandon Blackstock, who also worked as her manager. The "American Idol" alum, 38, and Blackstock share two children together: River Rose, 6, and Remington Alexander, 4.

As of late, the split has been marred with back-and-forth accusations of financial faults.

Biden, on the other hand, was married to a man named Bill Stevenson from 1970-1975 before marrying Joe Biden in 1977.

KELLY CLARKSON SAYS CO-PARENTING IS 'DIFFICULT' AMID SPLIT FROM EX BRANDON BLACKSTOCK

During Wednesday's episode of "The Kelly Clarkson Show," Dr. Biden opened up about her own divorce and offered words of encouragement to the singer, who has been open about the difficulties of divorce.

"This is what I would say to you if I were your mother. My mother always said, 'Things are going to look better tomorrow and if you can take one day at a time ... things will get better," Biden, 69, said. "I look back on it now and I think, 'You know if I hadn't gotten divorced, I never would have met Joe.'"

Additionally, Jill said she "wouldn't have the beautiful family I have now" had she not split from her first husband. Dr. Biden shares her 39-year-old daughter Ashley with the President, who had three children from a previous marriage.

Or at least that’s what Tripadvisor’s updated "Top 25 Beaches" list is suggesting, which ranked some of the most popular seaside destinations around the world.

The travel planning and review website made its determination based on user responses left on Tripadvisor.com in the last 12 months, according to a press release issued Tuesday.

TRAVEL REPORT IDENTIFIES TOP SEARCHED DESTINATIONS FOR SUMMER 2021

In Tripadvisor’s release, 10 U.S. beaches were highlighted as standouts for 2021. Five of which were in Hawaii and two were in Florida.

Meanwhile, the West Coast secured two spots in the top 10 and the East Coast secured one.

"Whether your preferred kind of beach is preened and pristine or rugged and rough, this list of travelers' favorites is just the inspiration you need to get planning your next beach break," said Tripadvisor’s Christine Maguire, who is a vice president and general manager of global media business at the company.

While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging people to avoid non-essential travel during the pandemic, the health agency is not against beach visits.

Instead, the CDC is advising Americans to make cautious considerations before they visit a public beach. Safety protocols the agency recommends include wearing face masks, sanitizing hands regularly and making an effort to social distance while avoiding large gatherings.Louisiana Republican Rep. Clay Higgins floated an environmental challenge to President Biden Tuesday – introducing a House resolution calling on the commander-in-chief to live without any petroleum products.

"American innovation, not job-killing government mandates, is driving emissions reductions," Higgins said in a statement. "However, if President Biden truly believes in his radical climate agenda, then he should lead by example starting at the White House."

H. Res. 149 begins by "calling on President Biden to immediately implement his radical climate agenda at the White House by prohibiting use of petroleum-based products and energy sources."

PSAKI PRESSED TO EXPLAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN MIGRANT FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN

Such items include smartphones, cameras, computers, coffee makers and surgical masks, among other common objects – as well as oil and gas energy.

To accomplish the latter, Higgins suggested "immediately detaching the White House from the electric grid" and installing wind mills and solar panels on the presidential lawn. The resolution also calls on Biden to replace Air Force One and Marine One with electric-powered aircraft and the presidential limousine with an electric car.

"Modern life is not possible without the oil and gas industry," Higgins said. "These energy sources fuel the world, and petroleum-based products are found in virtually everything everywhere."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Higgins, an Army veteran and former SWAT operator, earlier this month lambasted Biden’s climate policies in an op-ed published in the Lafayette-based Daily Advertiser.

"In the first two weeks, we’ve seen the administration revoke permits for the Keystone XL pipeline, enact a drilling moratorium for federal lands and waters, rejoin the misguided Paris Agreement, and begin implementing Green New Deal standards," he wrote. "The resurgence of these Obama-era policies will have the same outcome now as they did then, the destruction of American jobs, higher energy costs, and undermining global security interests. Those who will benefit the most include China and Russia."If you’ve ever thought about a move to the Ozarks, you’re not alone.

More than 26,000 people have applied for a program that will pay them to move to northwest Arkansas.

The Northwest Arkansas Council’s "Life Works Here" program is offering the money to remote workers willing to move to the region, Fox News previously reported. The program will also provide the new residents with a bicycle to enjoy the region’s miles of trails or a membership to a local art or cultural institution.

THESE 6 CITIES AND THIS STATE WILL PAY YOU TO MOVE TO THEM

The program has already selected its first 25 recipients, it announced this week. They include an executive chef and James Beard Foundation Impact Fellow from Atlanta, a digital marketing manager from Denver, a music producer and "creative community curator" from Los Angeles, a gaming producer from Los Angeles and a cloud technology manager from San Francisco, according to the announcement.

"This first wave of new talent to the northwest Arkansas region generated by the ‘Life Works Here’ campaign is just a sampling of the exceptional individuals we’ve been able to attract to our region with the incentive program," Northwest Arkansas Council CEO Nelson Peacock said in a press release.

Peacock said the group had been "overwhelmed by the unbelievable response." The applicants included people from all 50 states and more than 115 countries.

"This program is not only a benefit to the recipients and new talent for our region, but it also contributes to the vibrancy of our existing, growing market and our local economy," he said.

The program launched last November, thanks to support from the Walton Family Foundation. It had $1 million to offer to new residents, and the program is still accepting applicants.

"Professionals all over the country are starting to see the benefits of life in the Heartland, and Bentonville and Northwest Arkansas are at the top of the list," Steuart Walton said in a press release. "This region welcomes innovators and thought leaders to a community defined by world-class biking, cultural experiences and a true entrepreneurial spirit."

The area isn’t just known for its recreation opportunities. It’s also home to the headquarters of major businesses like Walmart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt Transport Services.

To qualify for the program, one needs to be able to move within six months, sign a lease for local housing or buy a home, be 24 or older, have at least two years of work experience and be employed full time. Candidates must also be U.S. citizens or be able to work legally in the U.S. and currently live outside Arkansas.

Ideal candidates will also be STEAM professionals or entrepreneurs, according to the program’s website. And they’re looking for people "who will add to the vibrancy of our community."

The announcement comes the same week that a similar program in Tulsa, Oklahoma announced that it was renewing itself and offering $10,000 up front for new residents who buy a home in the city. Previously, the Tulsa Remote program had only paid out the money in installments over the course of a year.The three major broadcast networks joined CNN and MSNBC Wednesday in avoiding mention of sexual harassment claims against Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo during their evening news programs.

According to Grabien transcripts, ABC's "World News Tonight," CBS' "Evening News," and NBC's "Nightly News" made no mention of the embattled Cuomo, who is facing calls for his impeachment and resignation after he was accused of covering up the number of deaths from COVID-19 in state nursing homes following his controversial order that assisted living facilities accept COVID-positive patients.

On Wednesday, Lindsey Boylan, Cuomo's former deputy secretary for economic development and special adviser, alleged in an essay published on the website Medium that the governor went "out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs," forcibly kissed her on the lips during a one-on-one briefing and suggested that they "play strip poker" during a plane ride.

The governor's office has denied Boylan's harassment claims, calling them "simply false" and insisting the strip poker comment "did not happen."

CNN GOES HOURS WITHOUT COVERING NEW SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ANDREW CUOMO

As NewsBusters previously noted, the three networks ignored Boylan when she took to Twitter back in December when she first made her sexual harassment claim against Cuomo, though she did not share details at the time.

CNN, the home network of the governor's brother Chris Cuomo, made zero mention of the allegations on its air or on CNN.com hours after Boylan came forward with her claims, according to Grabien transcripts and search results on the network's website.

MSNBC also skipped coverage of the sexual harassment allegations facing the already-embattled Democrat. However, the liberal network did offer brief coverage of Cuomo's ongoing nursing home scandal, reporting on a new Marist poll that showed 61% of New York voters believe Cuomo did something wrong with his handling of the state's nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.

GOV. CUOMO ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY FORMER AIDE

CNN, along with "Cuomo Prime Time" anchor Chris Cuomo, have made an unprecedented push to downplay and deflect from the controversies surrounding the New York Democrat, with the far-left network giving developments in the nursing home scandal little to no airtime -- while allowing the governor's anchor brother free rein to conduct friendly, comical interviews with the scandal-plagued governor in the early months of the pandemic.

While the governor is now facing allegations of sexual harassment and bullying from Boylan, the CNN anchor gushed in an interview from May that his brother was "single and ready to mingle."

Earlier this month, CNN said Chris Cuomo was barred from covering his brother and admitted network brass lifted the "rule" last year for the host to conduct his chummy fraternal interviews.

Gov. Cuomo's administration is reportedly under investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn after critics accused officials of covering up the true number of COVID nursing home deaths in the state. Early in the pandemic, the governor ordered assisted living facilities to accept COVID-positive patients in order to keep hospital beds free.Prominent Democrats in Washington are weaponizing identity politics to defend some of President Biden's most controversial Cabinet nominees from criticism.

Neera Tanden, Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M. and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra have all faced intense scrutiny for their policy positions and public statements, but some Democrats are suggesting that the nominees' critics are motivated by prejudice.

During Becerra's second confirmation hearing to become secretary of Health and Human Services on Wednesday, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., suggested that Becerra was "being held to a much different standard than some of the nominees" confirmed by the Senate during President Donald Trump's administration.

BIDEN CABINET NOMINEES TRAILED BY ETHICS CONCERNS

"Becerra and I, throughout our careers, have too often been the only Latinos in the room," the California senator went on to say. "Sadly Xavier and I are not unfamiliar with being held to different standards."

Republicans have pointed to Becerra’s lack of experience in health care, as well as his left-wing stance on abortion, as cause for concern. Becerra's record on religious liberty issues and coronavirus restrictions also emerged as points of contention.

Neera Tanden — Biden's pick to run the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — has seen bipartisan opposition to her nomination due in part to her history of tweeting inflammatory attacks towards senators from both parties. Tanden has since apologized for the tweets and deleted many of them.

NEERA TANDEN OUTED SEXUAL HARASSMENT VICTIM AT LIBERAL THINK TANK: REPORT

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. — an important swing vote in the 50-50 Senate — has said that he will vote against Tanden’s confirmation, arguing her tweets and public statements would have a "toxic and detrimental impact" on the relationship between OMB and Congress.

Other moderate senators soon followed suit in pulling their support for Tanden’s nomination, including Susan Collins, R-Maine, Rob Portman R-Ohio, Mitt Romney, R-Utah and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.

Democrats similarly argued that Tanden has been held to a higher standard than Trump nominees. Rep. Grace Meng, D. N.Y, told Politico that there was "this pattern that is happening and increasingly hard to ignore."

"We can disagree with her tweets, but in the past, Trump nominees that they've confirmed and supported had much more serious issues and conflicts than just something that was written on Twitter," she said. "This is not just about any one nominee like Neera, or whoever else — it's just about this pattern that is happening and increasingly hard to ignore."

Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., also said she believed there was a double standard towards Tanden and that the double standard was because Tanden "would be a pioneer in that position."

"There's a double standard going on," Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., told Politico. "Her nomination is very significant for us Asian American and Pacific Islanders. I do believe that this double standard has to do with the fact that she would be a pioneer in that position."

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., wrote on Twitter that it’s "a shame" he can't "tell little girls of South Asian descent that they'll have the same opportunities in life as white men" because of "what’s happening to [Tanden]."

Democrats have launched a "full-scale effort" to secure the needed votes to confirm Tanden. It is yet to be seen whether or not Democrats will succeed in winning over a Republican senator to help pull Tanden's nomination across the finish line.

Supporters of Haaland, Biden’s Interior secretary nominee, have also suggested that personal prejudice is to blame for hesitance from senators to confirm her. Republicans have expressed conern about Haaland's views on fracking and drilling on public lands.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., invoked Haaland's Native American heritage on Monday in a tweet criticizing Manchin for his hesitance to confirm Haaland.

Manchin said in a statement Wednesday that he intends to vote for Haaland after remaining on the fence, likely clearing the way for her confirmation.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., echoed Ocasio-Cortez in a tweet Wednesday, pointing out that Tanden, Haaland and Becerra "all happen to be people of color."

Jeffries asked if it was a "coincidence" that all three "are being targeted by some in the Senate for their 'radical views.'"China did "little" to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan during the first eight months of the pandemic, according to an internal World Health Organization report from August that was reviewed by The Guardian.

"Following extensive discussions with and presentation from Chinese counterparts, it appears that little had been done in terms of epidemiological investigations around Wuhan since January 2020," the report said, according to The Guardian.

Some WHO researchers returned from a fact-finding trip in Wuhan this month partially disappointed that China refused to share raw data about the first patients to get COVID-19.

Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert who was on the trip, told Reuters that the WHO team requested raw patient data on 174 people who caught COVID-19 in December 2019, but Chinese authorities only gave them a summary.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE HAS 'FAVORABLE SAFETY PROFILE,' FDA STAFF FINDS

The frustrations come as the Biden administration ramps up pressure on China to be more transparent about the origins of the pandemic.

"We need a credible, open, transparent international investigation led by the World Health Organization," national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS Sunday.

"We do not believe that China has made available sufficient original data into how this pandemic began to spread, both in China and then eventually around the world."

As the WHO and other researchers continue to investigate the origins of the pandemic, they are juggling multiple competing theories.

COVID-19 is widely believed to have jumped from a bat to an unknown intermediary animal, then to humans.

Researchers initially believed that the Huanan Seafood Market may have been where humans were first infected, as the market sold wild animals that are susceptible to viruses, but the discovery of earlier cases elsewhere has discredited this theory.

WHO researchers also investigated this month whether COVID-19 could have jumped from frozen food products, but many experts have downplayed this idea.

HOUSE TO VOTE ON BIDEN-BACKED CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE FRIDAY, STENY HOYER SAYS

In the waning days of the Trump administration, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's press ofiice issued a fact sheet that stated: "several researchers inside the [Wuhan Institute of Virology] became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses."

Furthur in the document, the State Department noted that the "U.S. government does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus—known as SARS-CoV-2—was transmitted initially to humans," Pompeo wrote Jan. 15. "We have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China."

The WHO has repeatedly thrown cold water on the theory that COVID-19 escaped from a lab in Wuhan though.

Peter Ben Embarek, the leader of the most recent WHO mission to China, said on Feb. 9 that the "laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population."

Despite that, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said recently that all options remain on the table.

"Some questions have been raised as to whether some hypotheses have been discarded," Ghebreyesus said at a press conference on Feb. 12, according to Reuters. "Having spoken with some members of the team, I wish to confirm that all hypotheses remain open and require further analysis and study."

The Associated Press contributed to this report.Xavier Becerra, President Biden’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to name any restriction on abortion that he would support when rigorously pressed on the issue during testimony before Senators on Wednesday.

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., asked Becerra point-blank if he would name an abortion restriction that he might support, which the California Attorney General declined to answer.

"Is there any line you would draw?" Daines asked. "Is there just one, just one restriction as it relates to abortion that you might support?"

GOP SENATORS QUESTION BECERRA QUALIFICATIONS TO LEAD HHS, PAST VOTE AGAINST PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN

Becerra repeatedly acknowledged that there are many different viewpoints on the important issue – and he respects all of them. But when it comes to his specific duties as Attorney General or HHS Secretary, it is his job to uphold the law.

"I have tried to make sure that I am abiding by the law because, whether it is a particular restriction or whether it’s the whole idea of abortion, whether we agree or not, we have to come to some conclusion," Becerra explained. "And that’s where the law gives us a place to go."

Daines noted that he did not get an answer and offered several options of his own, including a ban on the lethal discrimination of babies who are diagnosed with Down syndrome or a ban on sex-selective abortion.

"My job will be to make sure that I am following the law," Becerra responded.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, questioned Becerra about late-term abortions on Tuesday, where he gave similar answers.

The issue has become a lightning rod for Republicans for a number of reasons, including that Becerra voted against the "Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act" in 2003.Tom Holland has finally spilled the beans on the new "Spider-Man" movie title after trolling fans online.

On Wednesday, Holland, 24, took to Instagram to share a humorous video unveiling the title of the next "Spider-Man" installment.

In the video, Holland meets up with co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon after a meeting in director Jon Watts’ office — revealing that the director gave them "a fake name again."

"I just don’t understand why he keeps doing this," Holland said before Batalon, 24, pointed out, "It’s pretty obvious — you spoil things."

"Name me one thing that I’ve actually spoiled," Holland exclaimed, in which Zendaya, 24, noted, "The last movie title."

The video then pans over to a whiteboard revealing the actual title for the film: "Spider-Man: No Way Home."

The video comes off the heels of the three co-stars trolling fans online with fake subtitles for the upcoming Spidey flick — with Holland noting the film would be subtitled "Phone Home," Zendaya stating it would be "Home Slice" and Batalon saying it would be "Home Wrecker."

The announcement overall pokes fun at Holland’s well-noted tendency to spoil details of upcoming superhero films before it becomes public knowledge.

According to CinemaBlend, Holland has been guilty of accidentally spoiling "Spider-Man: Far from Home’s" title, the fact that his Spidey films are a part of a trilogy and on one occasion, he even spoiled "Avengers: Infinity War" for an entire movie theater.

The latest movie, which will hit theaters on Dec. 25, follows 2019's "Spider-Man: Far From Home" and 2017's "Spider-Man: Homecoming."Kelsey Grammer is returning as Dr. Frasier Craine in a reboot of the beloved series "Frasier" coming soon to Paramount+, CBS's rebranded streaming service.

A federal grand jury in Gainesville formally charged Mohamed Fathy Suliman, 33, a U.S. citizen, with attempting to provide material support for a designated foreign terrorist organization, according to court records. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison.

"Protecting national security is a top priority of this office," Lawrence Keefe, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Florida, said in a statement. "We are absolutely committed to deterring, disrupting and dismantling the plans of anyone who seeks to support a designated foreign terrorist organization."

According to the criminal complaint, Suliman booked a one-way flight in June 2014 from Orlando to Alexandria, Egypt, with stops in Chicago and Istanbul. Rather than traveling on to Egypt, Suliman paid cash for a one-way airline ticket to the Turkish-Syrian border town of Gaziantep, Turkey, officials said.

Suliman was arrested by Turkish authorities and accused of illegally crossing into Syria. He was eventually returned to the United States.

A search of Suliman's emails revealed attachments that contained various audio files that consisted of messages calling for jihad, officials said.

Earlier this month, an investigator in the case testified that "Sulliman said when he does not take his medication, he becomes depressed and manic," WCJB reported.

According to the outlet, Suliman told the agent he turns from a "moderate Muslim" to a "Jihadist Muslim, when he does not take his medication.

The Justice Department had backed Smith's case last year during the Trump administration.

Smith, who is fighting the rule after placing below a transgender runner in a meet, told "Fox News Primetime" that she and other female athletes "have worked really hard to get our stories out there to get people to realize that fairness needs to be restored in our sport and in all other women’s sports".

Smith hopes people will "realize that a lot of biological females have missed out on making it to meets that really matter...and the transgender athletes have taken spots on the podium that belong to biological females.

"We train for so many days a week, so many hours to be able to be the best in our state and the best in our region, and these biological males are just taking it away from us and we really deserve it."

Smith's attorney, Christiana Holcomb of the Alliance Defending Freedom, vowed the case will go ahead and called the DOJ's decision "politically motivated."

"What is even more concerning is this effort took gut legal protection for women is not just isolated to what we see in Connecticut," she said. "Even now, the Biden administration is pushing for the so-called Equality Act, which ignores the physical differences between men and women and threatens women’s privacy, women’s homeless shelters, and yes, even women's sports on a national level for female athletes like Alanna."

"Title IX was designed to ensure that girls like Alanna have a fair and level playing field," Holcomb concluded, "We want to move forward and we want to see women’s sports protected across the country."A 105-year-old New Jersey woman who beat COVID-19 shared her secrets for a long life, and at least one of them may be unexpected.

"You put them in a [mason] jar and keep them for nine days," she said. "After nine days, eat nine a day. It tastes like candy."

She experienced only mild symptoms and had a low-grade fever for one day, according to the report.

"I think people are fascinated by her story because they see that you can be 105 years old and still recover from this dreaded virus," Nieman told FOX 10. "And you can get your vaccine, even at an old age, and still be fine."

DeClerck's diet and prayer might not be the only things that have kept her living so long. Neiman told FOX 10 that she’s also "a very positive person."

Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., on Wednesday announced a formal appeal of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, D-Calif., fines that he has incurred for refusing to follow metal detector protocols.

"Today, with the assistance of my private counsel, I appealed the fines I incurred as a result of my refusal to abide by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s unconstitutional placement of magnetometers in front of the entrance to the Floor of the House of Representatives," Clyde wrote in a statement.

Clyde claimed installation of the magnetometers was part of an effort to treat Republican lawmakers "as a threat."

"The ongoing militarization of Capitol Hill, including the placement of metal fencing, razor wire, and the deployment of National Guard troops, are also part of this perverse strategy," he wrote.

The Georgia congressman said he filed his appeal with the House Ethics Committee.

A spokesperson for Pelosi's office did not return Fox News' request for comment.

As previously reported by Fox News, Republicans are pushing Pelosi to pay her own fine for bypassing the magnetometers.

A first-time offense generates a $5,000 penalty. But continued noncompliance ups the fine to $10,000 for additional violations.

The metal detectors were installed at the House in the wake of the Jan. 6 siege on Capitol Hill and have been opposed by some Republicans from the outset.A group of Republican senators is asking Amazon.com Inc. to explain why it recently removed a book about transgender issues that had been on sale on the platform for about three years.

In a letter to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos dated Wednesday, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Mike Braun of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri said a book by conservative scholar Ryan T. Anderson, "When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment," was no longer available on Amazon or on its Kindle and Audible platforms.

Amazon, they wrote, has been "unable to provide a sufficient explanation" as to how the book "supposedly violated a vague, undefined ‘offensive content’ standard."

An Amazon spokeswoman didn’t have a comment regarding the letter. In a statement earlier Wednesday, the company said it reserved the right not to sell certain content based on its content guidelines for books.

AMAZON ACCUSED OF 'ABSURD AND UNACCPETABLE' CENSORSHIP AFTER BOOK QUESTIONING TRANSGENDER MOVEMENT VANISHES

"All retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer and we do not take selection decisions lightly," the statement said.

In their letter, the senators wrote that Amazon’s move "openly signaled to conservative Americans that their views are not welcome on its platforms." They requested the company provide documentation explaining its decision, including whether the book violated an Amazon policy.

A spokesman for Encounter Books, a nonprofit based in New York City which publishes "When Harry Became Sally," said Wednesday that it had been informed by its distributor that the book was removed for violating Amazon’s content guidelines.

Under the category "Offensive Content," Amazon’s content guidelines include a sentence that reads: "We don’t sell certain content including content that we determine is hate speech, promotes the abuse or sexual exploitation of children, contains pornography, glorifies rape or pedophilia, advocates terrorism, or other material we deem inappropriate or offensive."

In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Anderson said he first learned that his book was no longer for sale on Sunday afternoon after a would-be book purchaser called him to say they couldn’t find the book on Amazon. Mr. Anderson then looked and also couldn’t find it.

"It’s hard to understand," said Mr. Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. "As far as I know I haven’t done anything. The book has been saying the same thing for three years." The book, which focuses on a variety of issues including gender identity, was originally published in February 2018.

In a tweet Wednesday, Mr. Anderson thanked the group of Republican senators for their support.

Leading tech platforms have been under criticism for implementing bans or suspensions of conservative figures. Twitter Inc. earlier this year permanently banned former President Trump’s personal account from its service, while Facebook Inc. moved to disable Mr. Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely.

Apple Inc., Amazon and Alphabet Inc.’s Google also recently took steps to boot Parler, a social-media app and website that has grown in popularity among conservatives. The actions against Mr. Trump and Parler starkly illustrate the companies’ influence over conversation online—and the political nature of their decisions. While lauded by many, ejecting the president and some of his supporters also infuriated others who said it amounts to censorship.

A longstanding truism in the book business is that the only bad publicity is no publicity, and that appears to be true for Mr. Anderson as well. The print edition is now sold out at BarnesandNoble.com, but on late Wednesday afternoon the ebook ranked No. 3 on the bookseller’s Top 100 list for digital books.

A spokesman for Encounter Books on Wednesday said the publisher has reordered 5,000 paperback copies.Rosanna Arquette took to Twitter on Tuesday to address Tiger Woods' shocking car crash that has left him with several injuries.

"I know ya’ll don’t because I just found out this year but you have about a month to sign a long term deal after being franchised tagged," Judon wrote on his Instagram story. "If a deal doesn’t get done in that time. Ain’t no deal or no talking between the two parties. @jamison.hensley so I’m waiting on your ESPN sourced apology or I’m leaking these photos I got with you in the strip club."

"Where @jamisonhensley lying butt at? I got time today," Judon wrote. "Bro you have to stop lying, I know you want clicks and like and wanna be the people’s camp but stop lying. That weak."

Hensley responded: "Hi Matthew. I was told that Ravens offered you a deal similar to Za’Darius’ [Smith] ($16.5M per season) earlier this season and it was declined. If you have a comment, I would certainly add that to the piece. I’ve always been fair with you. Thanks and welcome back to Twitter."

Police started tracking two vehicles that were observed at the scene earlier in the day. About five hours later, police pulled over a van 200 miles from the scene that matched the description of one of the cars at the murder scene.

That's when police say Hunter Chenoweth, 22, exited the van armed with a rifle and started "verbally provoking" the officers.

The cops were eventually able to apprehend Chenoweth shortly after 10 p.m.

The abducted baby was found inside the van unharmed, as well as a 25-year-old woman who was driving. She was questioned by police and released.

A cattle ranch beside the top-secret military base in Alamo, Nevada, has recently hit the market for $4.5 million.

The 80-acre ranch -- which comes with cattle and equipment -- even has a grazing permit for 250 cows to go onto Area 51.

The property can support up to 750 cows and has a 5,600-square-foot hay barn, a 1,248-square-foot barn and a 576-square foot shop.

The ranch also includes two "newer manufactured homes": a four-bedroom, three-bathroom home with a wraparound deck as well as a three-bedroom, two-bathroom guest house, the listing says.

According to Vice, the current owners, Steve and Glenda Medlin, worked out a deal with the U.S. Air Force to get the grazing permit for Area 51 several years ago.

However, the permit comes with a catch -- before the cows can go onto Area 51, the ranch owner has to contact the base in advance using a radio the government gave to the Medlins.

Tourists have flocked to the Medlins’ property because of the lore surrounding Area 51. In fact, their mailbox has been called "the most photographed mailbox in the world," according to the New York Post.

Vice reported that many visitors to the area believed the mailbox had something to do with supposed alien sightings, so for decades people have vandalized the mailbox, stolen the Medlins’ mail, left letters for the aliens or even just shot the mailbox.

To get tourists to leave their actual mailbox alone, the Medlins replaced the black one with a white, bulletproof mailbox with a padlock, Vice reported. The couple also put up another, smaller mailbox labeled "ALIENS" and "DROP BOX."

However, they no longer use either mailbox for their mail, according to the website.Tommy Pickles and the gang are back.

"Having the voice cast behind these special characters come together is one of the essential pieces to making the show recognizable and we can’t wait to watch this talented group bring them to life again."

"A lot of people like to say what we’re seeing here in the white supremacist movement is really an act of patriotism or politics -- no, this is tribalism at its rawest form," the Founder and Executive Director of Terror Asymmetrics Project said during a hearing Wednesday on domestic terrorism.

NBC ANALYST WITH HISTORY OF PUSHING CONSPIRACY THEORIES TESTIFIES AT DEM-LED HEARING ON DOMESTIC TERRORISM

"One of the reasons why we have a lot of heartburn with what happened with the insurrection on the Capitol, and why it is not equivalent to the protests in Portland...was the fact that they came to overthrow the government and to install a president as a monarch, as a dictator," Nance continued. "That is the difference here, it has never happened in American history, even the South attempted to use tenants of the Constitution for secession."

Wednesday’s hearing was intended to address the rise in domestic terrorism in the U.S. and how to best handle it from a law enforcement and congressional perspective.

Republicans said the committee should also consider Antifa’s actions during the summer riots, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where the group that stands for Anti-Fascist, held nightly violent riots in Portland and Seattle.

But the hearing became tense after Florida Republican Greg Steube grew frustrated with the witnesses who would not agree that the summer riots constituted domestic terrorism.

Steube prompted severe backlash from Missouri Democrat Rep. Cori Bush after he suggested the Black Lives Matter movement should also be considered domestic terrorism.

Bush, who got her political start by participating in the Black Lives Matter movement following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, condemned the Florida Republican.

"I’m one of those Black Live Matter activists you’re talking about," she said following Steube’s time. "We cannot equate white nationalist violence with…a righteous movement for justice.

"But for white supremacy in which you benefit, we would not be in the streets demanding to be heard to save lives. And let me say this -- had you fixed it before now, we wouldn’t be here," she added.

MCCONNELL SAYS PELOSI COMMISSION PROPOSAL TO INVESTIGATE JAN. 6 HAS 'PARTISAN SLANT,' WON'T BE 'LEGITIMATE'

Former FBI agent Michael German said the reason that white supremacy is rarely categorized as domestic terrorism, is because federal officials often treat an incident as a "stand-alone" offense, or pass it off to local officials -- meaning the crime’s data are not properly collected.

Nance frustrated Republican committee witness, Andy Ngo -- a Portland-based journalist who has been physically assaulted by Antifa – after the Democrat said that the riots this summer equate to "civil disobedience" rather than actual domestic terrorism.

"For whatever you want to say about what happened in Portland or Seattle or Kenosha, those were not acts of terrorism...they were acts of civil disobedience and protests," Nance said during Wednesday’s hearing. "We’ve seen equal vigor at Super Bowl protests, where we’ve seen fire and fights."

Ngo -- who later pushed back on Nance’s comments on Twitter -- called on the congressional lawmakers to cool their rhetoric and consider investigating all forms of political extremism.

"Anybody who defends the institutions of this country [Antifa views] as fascistic in one way or another," Ngo said, adding that "they’re calling for the overthrow of the American government.

"I’m not here to say that there is no threat coming from the far right, that’s not my area of expertise," he told the committee. "At the beginning, we heard that 75 percent of deaths from domestic terrorist attacks come from the far right, does that mean that the other 25 percent doesn’t deserve attention – I don’t think so."

"It’s about keeping all Americans safe, and that includes investigating all extremist ideologies," Ngo added.Newly engaged Ricki Lake has shared some surprising details of her engagement to her fiancé Ross Burningham.

Fox News' Cortney Moore contributed to this report.Sometimes the people looking after a building get a little behind on maintenance. Sometimes the same thing happens to the people looking after the International Space Station.

Two astronauts are preparing for a spacewalk this weekend to prepare for the upcoming replacement of the solar arrays designed to last 15 years and were installed on the ISS more than 20 years ago, according to NASA.

Flight engineers Kate Rubins and Victor Glover will step out of the ISS for the spacewalk. They’ll be assembling and installing equipment for the upcoming upgrades that will both replace the current degrading solar arrays and increase the station’s available power from 160 kW to 215 kW, according to NASA. A SpaceX rocket is scheduled to deliver new arrays later this year.

HERE’S HOW NASA’S PERSEVERANCE ROVER WILL SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS

This will be the third spacewalk for both astronauts.

"The on-orbit crew this week has been very busy," Flight Director Marcos Flores said during a news conference Wednesday. "They’ve been working a lot to make sure that they have all their procedures reviewed and all their training completed."

The astronauts are scheduled to step out at about 6 a.m. EST on Sunday. The spacewalk is expected to last about six and a half hours.

The spacewalk on Sunday is the first of two upcoming maintenance spacewalks scheduled for the ISS. On March 5, Rubins will venture out again with Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi to vent ammonia, among other tasks. They’ll also install a "stiffener" on the airlock thermal cover.

These will be the 235th and 236th spacewalks from the ISS.

While some of the astronauts aboard the ISS were preparing for their upcoming spacewalks, others were busy unpacking four tons of cargo that arrived on a Northrup Grumman Cygnus resupply ship, according to NASA. Equipment delivered to the station includes supplies, new science hardware like freezers for biological samples and other equipment.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who faced intense scrutiny Wednesday after a former aide accused him of sexual harassment, called for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to submit to a lie-detector test amid allegations of sexual assault in 2018.

Cuomo spoke out in September 2018 amid Senate hearings regarding Kavanaugh’s potential appointment to the court. At the time, Kavanaugh’s prospects were in doubt following allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who testified under oath that the judge sexually assaulted her at a 1982 party when they were high school students.

CUOMO AIDE DENIES LINDSEY BOYLAN CLAIM THAT GOVERNOR ASKED HER TO PLAY STRIP POKER

In a statement directed at then-President Donald Trump, Cuomo said he found Ford’s testimony "very compelling." He pointed out that Ford, unlike Kavanaugh, had taken a polygraph test, and called on Trump to "insist" that the judge take a test.

"Here is one basic fact that badly hurts Judge Kavanaugh: Why won't he take a polygraph? Dr. Ford did," Cuomo said. "If he does not take a polygraph test, it is the ultimate, 'he said, she said.' It is the one powerful piece of evidence that seriously damages his credibility and the credibility of his Republican supporters, including yourself. You can and should ask him to take the test.

"If he refuses, you should pull the appointment," Cuomo added. "It will show at least a modicum of fairness on your part. If you do not insist that Judge Kavanaugh take a polygraph, it will be further evidence that you are putting political motivation over your constitutional obligation. Do not aid and abet a lie. Demand a polygraph."

Kavanaugh repeatedly denied the allegation and was later confirmed to the Supreme Court despite stiff opposition. The New York Post was first to resurface Cuomo’s remarks.

Lindsey Boylan, a former Cuomo aide and current candidate for Manhattan borough president, accused the governor of various instances of sexual harassment and unwanted touching during her tenure in the administration. Boylan alleged that Cuomo asked her to play "strip poker" during a 2017 flight, kissed her on the lips during an encounter in his New York City office and "went out of his way" to touch her.

Cuomo’s press secretary, Caitlin Girouard, dismissed Boylan’s allegations and cited former aides who asserted that the conversation about strip poker "did not happen."

"As we said before, Ms. Boylan's claims of inappropriate behavior are quite simply false," Girouard said in a statement.Country legends Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood have shared a health update after being tested for coronavirus.

In a press release, a rep for Brooks, 59, confirmed that he had tested negative while Yearwood, 56, tested positive.

According to the release, the pair were already quarantining "at home on the heels of a recent positive Covid test by a member of their team."

"The Queen and I have now tested twice," said Brooks. "Officially, she’s diagnosed as ‘on her way out of the tunnel’ now, though, which I’m extremely thankful for."

GARTH BROOKS REVEALS TRISHA YEARWOOD'S PET PEEVE ABOUT HIM: 'IT'S REALLY LIKE A 24/7 THING'

"Anyone who knows me knows my world begins and ends with Miss Yearwood, so she and I will ride through this together," the star shared, adding that he would not be participating in his Inside Studio G series on Facebook for a time.

"And anyone who knows [Yearwood] knows she's a fighter and she's been doing everything right, so I know we’ll walk out the other side of this thing together," Brooks said.

Yearwood is "dealing with symptoms," said the release, but is "doing okay."

Stewart verified allegations first reported by the National File, revealing that AT&T executive Ed Gillespie requested that the department keep China Telecom off of what is called the "entities list," reserved for foreign companies who are engaged in human rights or national security violations.

China Telecom, headquartered in Beijing, is involved in a joint venture with AT&T -- which owns Warner Media, the parent company of CNN -- and was set to be sanctioned due to its alleged support of human rights abuses by China's Communist government.

"It was very disturbing because we had a lot of indications, there is very good intelligence out there, that the Chinese government, through its basically state-owned subsidiary of China Telecom has been using cell phone technology, telecommunications technology, to track minority populations in China, to spy on them, and then to hand this information over to the China police state, and they are rounding up the Uyghur population...," Stewart said.

CHINA STATE-OWNED MEDIA USES TIME SQUARE VIDEO SCREENS FOR ADS

Stewart cited intelligence revealing that the Chinese government was regularly "placing these people in essentially modern-day concentration camps, where there is widespread reports of gang rapes, torture, human rights abuses, potentially even executions and genocides happening in these camps, and China Telecom was assisting the government of China in helping to do that.

"When we learned of this, of course, the Trump Administration began to place China Telecom on the entities list, to put sanctions upon them, when we were contacted by Ed Gillespie, the executive vice president of AT&T, who urged us not to place China Telecom, despite these abuses, on the entity list. Needless to say, we were pretty much shocked by that."

Stewart added that AT&T's action "doesn’t make sense unless you assume that despite what CNN and its corporate parent say about protecting minorities and standing up for human rights, it's all a lie, and what they are actually doing is placing profit over and above human rights, over and above U.S. national security concerns. And you know, I have to say that AT&T is not alone."

"Let me say this," Stewart concluded, "the career staff at the Commerce Department were clearly on a path to do this. If it does not happen, that will mean there was pressure from the Biden administration, put on it by AT&T to not put them on there."

Stewart challenged Gillepsie in the Virginia Republican gubneratorial primary in 2017.

In a statement to "Tucker Carlson Tonight," AT&T admitted that it did not want China Telecom to be sanctioned, saying: "Without a relationship with a licensed Chinese communications company, no non-Chinese provider can serve U.S. companies operating in China.

"In the absence of that, such support would be provided by a Chinese state-owned enterprise instead of AT&T or any other American company. We and other companies explained this to the Commerce Department and other government officials to inform their policy decision about potential unintended consequences of placing China Telecom on the entities list."A Texas utility customer impacted by the state's devastating winter storms this month filed a $1 billion class-action lawsuit against wholesale electricity retailer Griddy Energy LLC on Monday, accusing the company of "unlawful price gouging."

The plaintiff, Lisa Khoury of Mont Belvieu, alleges in the suit that while her monthly electricity bills from Griddy were around $200 to $250, the company automatically withdrew $1,200 from Feb. 13-18 and her entire bill was $9,546 from Feb. 1-19.

TEXAS RESIDENT HAS NEARLY $17,000 DEDUCTED FROM BANK ACCOUNT BY ENERGY COMPANY FOLLOWING WINTER STORM

Khoury claimed she expressed concern over the withdrawals and bouncing checks to Griddy, but never heard back from the company and ultimately placed a stop payment order with her bank on Feb. 18.

The suit, which was filed in the 133rd District Court of Harris County "on behalf of all others similarly situated," seeks $1 billion in monetary relief.

In addition, the lawsuit accuses Griddy of violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and seeks an injunction to prevent Griddy from billing and collecting payment for excessive prices and to assure the forgiving of any late or unpaid bills from affected customers.

"Griddy charged Khoury in the middle of a disaster. She and her husband mostly were without power in their home from Wednesday, February 17, 2021 to Thursday, February 18, 2021. At the same time, Khoury hosted her parents and in-laws, who are in their 80s, during the storm. Even then, she continued to minimize any power usage because of the high prices," the suit explains.

They noted that Gritty's wholesale rate reached $9,000 per megawatt-hour from the pre-storm rate of $50 per megawatt-hour, and said that Griddy told customers it was "seeking relief from utility regulators" after advising 29,000 customers to switch to another provider with a fixed rate.

MILLIONS IN TEXAS FACING WATER ISSUES AS STATE STILL REELING FROM EFFECTS OF DEADLY WINTER STORM

Khoury was able to change providers on Feb. 19, the suit said.

"Griddy knew it was overcharging consumers, that consumers would be harmed, and Griddy would be unjustly enriched by retaining customers’ payments," it concludes.

A man in Arlington was stunned to receive a bill for more than $17,000 from Griddy over a period of just five days.

In a Tuesday release, Khoury's attorney Derek Potts -- who heads the Potts Law Firm in Houston -- said there are likely thousands of customers who received the bills and that the class action would "be the most efficient and effective way for Griddy's customers to come together and fight this predatory pricing."

"The case is tremendously important to the firm as it allows us to represent the people of our state who have now endured not one but two natural disasters at the same time, the storm plus COVID-19," Potts told Fox News on Wednesday.

"What happened financially to all of the customers of Griddy both in terms of the exorbitant prices charged and the manner in that they were collected from peoples’ bank accounts and credit cards literally in the middle of a catastrophe while many were without power, heat, and water, is clearly contrary to Texas laws in place to protect consumers," he said.

Fox News reached out to Griddy but did not immediately receive a response.

However, in a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson said the lawsuit was "meritless," shifting blame to the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

On its website, the company wrote in a blog post that "transparency" had always been its goal and that it, too, was "pissed." The company has vowed to fight the prices.

The Kardashian sister and co-founder of fashion brand, Good American, recently unveiled a new promotional campaign for the company’s first footwear collection.

"The pictures are too elongated," one commenter wrote. "It started with the latest Skims ad. Stop this."

"Why are her feet so long," another commenter asked.

Kardashian was quick to respond and clear any confusion — citing that it was the angle of the camera and the type of lens that created the look.

"The closer the object is to camera they will get elongated. So in some of my photos my feet/fingers look incredibly long. Not to worry! I still have normal size hands/fingers."

Hurst was convicted of killing a city police officer in 1967 and originally sentenced to death in the electric chair. After the U.S. Supreme Court halted capital punishment in 1972, he received a new sentence of 100 to 300 years in prison.

SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN JUSSIE SMOLLETT INVESTIGATION FINDS KIM FOXX'S OFFICE MISHANDLED CASE

Foxx did not immediately explain her reversal. In a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times, she said her office’s "lack of opposition should not be construed as a show of support but rather the office’s position that we would no longer actively object."

She noted that Officer Herman Stallworth’s family strongly opposes parole.

Stallworth, 37, was a Navy veteran and eight-year member of the Chicago Police Department when he was gunned down in the line of duty on May 23, 1967, according to the Chicago Police Memorial Foundation. He had a wife and four children.

Stallworth and his partner, Officer Eugene Ervin, had pulled over Hurst, then 24, in a traffic stop on Cottage Grove Avenue. When Ervin returned to the patrol vehicle to call in the plates, Hurst shot Stallworth multiple times in the torso.

Hurst then shot and severely wounded Ervin, who called for backup, received treatment and eventually recovered, according to the Foundation.

Hurst allegedly tried to flee and continued to fire as backup officers arrived until he ran out of bullets. Then he surrendered. He was on probation for a prior robbery crimes at the time.

Hurst’s parole is the second of a convicted cop killer Foxx has dropped her opposition to since a wave of anti-police protests across the country over the summer.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.Have you ever noticed that nobody in Washington can agree on a number? You would think that people with functioning calculators could come to similar math- based conclusions once in a while, but not in D.C. Try getting a consensus on unemployment projections or consumer confidence levels from members of Congress. You can't even get a straight answer on how many troops will be occupying the Capitol three months from now, and that's something they directly control.

With all of that in mind, it's pretty amazing to watch virtually everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat, repeat precisely the same number when discussing one of the most critical problems that we face. That number is 11 million. That number, they tell us, is exactly how many foreign nationals currently live here illegally.

It's almost like a script now. People have different views on what we ought to do about illegal immigrants, but nobody questions how many there are. There are 11 million, period.

A month before last year's presidential election, Joe Biden promised: "Within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people, and all of those so-called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship."

TRUMP, AT CPAC, EXPECTED TO HAMMER BIDEN ON IMMIGRATION, CHINA

Joe Biden is in the White House now. His party controls everything, so he can make good on that promise and he plans to do so. In fact, it's one of the very first things he's doing. How's it going to affect you?

First of all, it's kind of a big deal. All but seven U.S. states have fewer than 11 million people living in them. We're not just talking about Wyoming and South Dakota, but states like Virginia, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts and so on. What will this cost? It's kind of hard to know the real answer, but if you're trying to put the math together, be sure to factor in the free health care.

It doesn't take an economist to know that giving free "health care" to 11 million new people could easily capsize the U.S. economy. As Milton Friedman once wisely noted, you can have a welfare state or you can have open borders, but you cannot have both. However, we're getting both. We may, in fact, be getting a great deal more than that.

We all assume that 11 million is the real number of illegal aliens in this country, but is it? No, it's not. In fact, it's a totally fake number which people endlessly repeat either because they are badly informed or dishonest. They've been repeating that number for more than 15 years.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN BACKS CITIZENSHIP FOR 11 MILLION IMMIGRANTS AHEAD OF BILL UNVEILING

In 2005, the Pew Research Center announced that "the undocumented population has reached nearly 11 million." The weird thing is that 12 years later, Pew had roughly the same estimate. That should have been a tell that the number itself was fraudulent.

In 2018, the Department of Homeland Security, which exists to track numbers like these, played along with it and put the number of illegal aliens in the U.S. at somewhere around 12 million. Yeah, right. In April 2019, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen admitted on "Tucker Carlson Tonight" that "we do not know" exactly how many people are living in this country illegally.

So what's going on here? Here's what we found: Pretty much everybody who talks about immigration is using the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey to estimate how many illegal immigrants live in this country. The Census Bureau tallies up the number of foreign-born people they've identified who live in this country, then estimate or subtract the number of foreign-born people known to be in the U.S. legally. Bingo, 11 million.

The problem is this method of calculation is bound to be wrong. Many illegal immigrants don't respond to census takers. Why would they say they're here illegally? Robert Groves, the former director of the Census Bureau, summed up the reality this way: "There is no magic bullet that anyone has discovered to count this population [illegal immigrants]. This is really very difficult to estimate."

Now, many of the studies projecting that only 11 million illegal immigrants live here, have, in fact, acknowledged that the census is not perfect. Yet strangely, they assumed that it was pretty close to perfect. Specifically, they operated on the assumption that only about 10% of illegal immigrants weren't being captured by census takers. Put another way, their models assumed that 90% of the people living in this country illegally were willing to cooperate with census takers.

Now, that seems like a ridiculous assumption, but there's a reason. Ann Coulter explains that reason in her book "Adios America," which even now is one of the few serious explorations of this topic. It turns out that researchers have been relying on a 2001 study funded by the University of California. That survey asked 829 people born in Mexico and living in Los Angeles whether they responded to census interviews. The majority of them said yes.

Here's the amazing thing. Nearly 40% of those households refused to answer the survey at all. In other words, all the assumptions that there are 11 million illegal immigrants in this country are based on a separate assumption: That 90% of illegal immigrants are willing to cooperate with the Census Bureau. That assumption, in turn, is based on a survey showing nearly half of all illegal immigrants refused to fill out the survey. This is bad math at the very least.

BIDEN HHS PICK BECERRA SAYS TAXPAYER-FUNDED HEALTHCARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NOT SUPPORTED BY LAW

In 2018, researchers at Yale and MIT decided to update the methodology using "operational data" such as deportations, visa overstays, demographic data, death rates, immigration rates, etc. They combined them and used a mathematical model to establish a range of estimates.

How many people live here illegally? Here's what they found: "After running 1,000,000 simulations of the model, the researchers' 95% probability range is 16 million to 29 million, with 22.1 million as the mean."

In other words, the estimates that we've been relying on for decades could possibly -- in fact, may likely -- be off by more than 18 million people. There could easily be 30 million (or more) illegal immigrants living in this country. That's more people than live in the entire state of Texas.

So how would amnesty for that many people affect our "democracy"? In effect, it would end our democracy. People who have lived here all of their lives, paid taxes, followed the rules, been good citizens, would find their votes diluted to the point of irrelevance. (It would mean an instantaneous end to African-American political power, for one thing.) It would also ensure permanent rule by the Democratic Party, which is the point of it.

HOW TRUMP CLINCHED FLORIDA VICTORY WITH HELP OF HISPANICS

By the way, back in 2005, Bear Stearns, one of the most prominent victims of the 2008 financial collapse, estimated the total illegal immigrant population to be as high as 20 million. Here was their top-line finding in that study:

"Our research has identified significant evidence that the census estimates of undocumented immigrants may be capturing as little as half of the total undocumented population. This gross undercounting is a serious accounting issue which could ultimately lead to government policy errors in the future."

"Government policy errors" like giving amnesty to 11 million who are actually 30 million? Yeah, that could qualify.

TUCKER: UNDER BIDEN, YOU NEED A NEGATIVE COVID TEST TO ENTER US -- UNLESS YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN

The Bear Stearns study did not rely on census data. Instead, they looked at bank transfers, remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. They wanted to capture the number of payments from illegal aliens living here to their families back home. Here's what they found:

"The rate of increase in remittances far exceeds the increases in Mexicans residing in the U.S. and their wage growth. Between 1995 and 2003, the official tally of Mexicans has climbed 56% and median weekly wage income has increased by 10%. Yet total remittances jumped 199%"

There was no obvious explanation for this disparity, apart from a lot more illegal immigration than the authorities were acknowledging.

HOUSE GOP MEMBERS TELL BIDEN 'FAR-LEFT' IMMIGRATION AGENDA CREATING BORDER CRISIS

The researchers at Bear Stearns looked at other indicators, too For example, they analyzed data on school enrollment and housing permit applications for multiple dwellings. In one instance, they found that some towns in New Jersey reported a 5-6% growth in population size. At the same time, requests for housing permits were increasing by 600%.

"In major immigrant gateway cities," the study found, "the influx of immigrants has led to overcrowded dwellings and a housing boom unexplained by official population growth."

That was all 16 years ago, and in 2021, the party in charge is still assuring us that the number of illegal immigrants in this country has somehow declined by up to 10 million people. How insulting is that to even to float that idea? Consider everything that has happened since 2006: The amnesty for the so-called "Dreamers," the promises of mass amnesty, the endless caravans.

The 11 million number is, above all, a lie; one of the more obvious lies ever told. We're not social scientists, and it took about an hour for us to find this out.

Joe Biden knows this. In the summer of 2019, he more or less admitted the point of amnesty: To import as many new Democratic voters as possible.

BIDEN: We could afford to take, in a heartbeat, another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people cannot absorb people who are in desperate need and who are justifiably fleeing oppression is absolutely bizarre, absolutely bizarre. I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States.

Of course, they won't tell you the total number. They want you to believe it's 11 million, always and forever. By the time you figure out they're lying to you, it'll be too late to do anything about it, obviously.

This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Feb. 24, 2021 edition of "Tucker Carlson Tonight."Members of the Washington D.C. City Council called Wednesday for the removal of three miles of security fencing placed around the U.S. Capitol as a defensive measure in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the councilmembers said a "hardened security perimeter," with fencing and razor wire, was the "wrong solution." The security fencing has created logistical problems within the city, impacted local legislative operations and limited public access to the Capitol complex, they added.

"We offer our full support and partnership to both investigate the deficiencies that led to the failures on January 6 and implement any changes in command or planning needed to ensure those events will never be repeated," the councilmembers said in the letter obtained by Fox 5 DC. "But permanent fencing, blocked streets, or diminished public access is not the way to secure the Capitol."

The city council expressed support for Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C, who introduced legislation earlier this month that would block Capitol authorities from installing a permanent fence around the area. Norton likened the concept to "security theater based on 19th-century ideas" and, like the local lawmakers, argued it would limit public access.

Authorities stepped up efforts to secure the Capitol after pro-Trump protestors stormed the building in an unprecedented security breach. Lawmakers were forced to flee the building as they met to confirm President Biden’s election victory.

Acting U.S. Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman had called for permanent fencing and other enhanced measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. This week, Congress held the first hearing in a bid to determine what went wrong with existing security protocols on Jan. 6.Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) performed roughly10,000 more abortions in 2018-2019 than in the previous year.

According to its most recent annual report, the abortion giant was responsible for 354,871 abortions for that time period. That number was the highest recorded since the year 2000, according to tracking by the pro-life group Live Action, and represented a nearly 3% increase from the 345,672 reported for the previous year.

Since 2000, the group has reportedly performed more than 5.6 million abortions and is generally considered the nation's largest provider. For the past several years, it has performed the procedure more than 300,000 times annually.

Panned Parenthood's services also include various forms of contraception.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD CEO: IT'S 'STIGMATIZING' TO SAY ABORTION IS A SMALL PART OF OUR WORK

During 2020, Planned Parenthood and others insisted that abortions were "essential" services that should be permitted while states prohibited other elective procedures in order to preserve personal protective equipment.

"This year tested our promise to Planned Parenthood patients: that we would be here for them, no matter what," the abortion provider said. "Through the COVID-19 pandemic, attacks on access to abortion, and the gag rule that blocked access to care for Title X patients — we kept our promise."

The report touts the group's ability to reach women despite state restrictions by utilizing its abortion service locator. Since its September 2019 launch, the locator tool has received 767,000 visits.

Besides lockdowns, state legislatures and courts continued to weigh pro-life restrictions which have encountered concerted backlash from the abortion provider.

"PPFA and Planned Parenthood affiliates have approximately three dozen open cases challenging laws, policies, or government actions that restrict access to sexual and reproductive health," the group reported.

And despite efforts to defund the group, PPFA and Planned Parenthood Global combined received $618.1 million in government funding in FY2020. According to Live Action's tracking, which dates back to the year 2000, that could be the largest sum in PPFA's history. Their most recent figures represent a 205% increase from the $202.7 million recorded for 2000.

The organization briefly lost millions of dollars in federal funding after the Trump administration conditioned Title X grants on whether recipients used abortion as a method of family planning. Totaling $33.6 million, the money was redirected towards health departments and clinics across a long list of states as part of the previous administration's effort to close the gaps in patient resources after organizations lost their funding.Fox News host Sean Hannity reacted Wednesday night to the reports suggesting House Democrats were urging President Biden to relinquish his nuclear authority.

In his "Hannity" monologue, Hannity called the effort "totally humiliating" for Biden, whose cognitive ability was regularly called into question during the 2020 presidential campaign.

A letter signed by three dozen House Democrats reportedly asks the 78-year-old Biden to renounce his sole authority to launch nuclear weapons.

"Must be totally humiliating for Joe Biden," Hannity said.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ASK BIDEN TO RENOUNCE SOLE NUCLEAR AUTHORITY

"Now, first of all, it's unconstitutional. That's first of all. There is one commander-in-chief. It is not the U.S. Congress. There is zero constitutional ambiguity here. But second of all, what do these Democrats know about Joe Biden that maybe the rest of us don't?" the host continued.

"There is one commander-in-chief. It is not the U.S. Congress. There is zero constitutional ambiguity here." — Sean Hannity

The Democratic lawmakers write: "While any president would presumably consult with advisors before ordering a nuclear attack, there is no requirement to do so. The military is obligated to carry out the order if they assess it is legal under the laws of war. Under the current posture of U.S. nuclear forces, that attack would happen in minutes," the letter reads.

Democrats offered some alternatives to sole nuclear authority, such as requiring the vice president and House speaker to agree with a launch order from the president before it is executed, according to Politico.

"They didn't propose this even when Donald Trump was president -- and they all hated Donald Trump," Hannity said.

"They didn't propose this even when Donald Trump was president -- and they all hated Donald Trump." — Sean Hannity

The effort indicates growing concern among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over Biden's cognitive ability, Hannity said.

"He is frail. He is weak. And he is struggling cognitively," Hannity said. "If he ever had a fastball, I would argue it's long gone.

"Let me also be clear," Hannity continued."I'm not making any medical diagnosis about Joe Biden and this is not about his age. For example, Bernie Sanders is a year older than Joe Biden here and he has way more energy, way more stamina, way more mental alertness, fighting every day for his insane socialist utopia. Donald Trump, similar age, boundless energy and alertness."

By contrast, Hannity argued, "Joe Biden always seems like he needs a nap."Just weeks after voting in support of the second impeachment of former President Donald Trump, U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is already facing a pro-Trump GOP primary challenger.

His opponent? Catalina Lauf, a 27-year-old who previously served in the Trump administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. She launched her bid Tuesday to oust the 42-year-old incumbent in Illinois' 16th Congressional District.

"I never thought I'd primary a fellow Republican, but is Congressman Kinzinger really a Republican anymore? He isn't and we have the proof," Lauf says in a video campaign announcement.

GOP CANDIDATE CATALINA LAUF SAYS MAINSTREAM MEDIA 'CAN'T FATHOM' A 'YOUNG LATINA' TRUMP SUPPORTER

Lauf attacks Kinzinger as a "weak-kneed, establishment Republican" who "cares more about his next MSNBC appearance than the voters who elected him."

She suggests that the sitting congressman does not support the "America First" movement, pointing to his "one in three votes" in Congress that have sided with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

"Instead of being in our fight, Adam betrayed his constituents for a life in the D.C. swamp," Lauf says.

She then slams the "Fake Republican" for supporting the "phony impeachment hoax for a president who has already left office."

"He said impeachment was 'necessary to save America.' What?" Lauf reacts. "You know what I think is necessary to save America, Adam? Setting term limits for people like you and the rest of your friends out. Six terms in Congress is enough."

Lauf goes on to accuse Kinzinger of "further fan[ning] flames" by "divid[ing] our party."

Among the candidate's listed priorities she sets to tackle on Capitol Hill include "social media censorship," "election integrity," "freedom of speech," "gun rights," "illegal immigration," and "keeping the economy going."

Lauf previously ran for Congress in Illinois' 14th Congressional District in 2020 but was defeated in a crowded GOP primary by state Sen. Jim Oberweis, who fell short in the general election against Democratic incumbent Rep. Lauren Underwood by less than 2 percent.

Lauf prides herself as the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant mother, who came to the U.S. legally, and a small business owner father. She also branded herself as the "anti-AOC."

Both she and her sister Madeline were prominently featured in a video during last year's Republican National Convention in support of President Trump.Stevie Wonder has plans to move on.

The 70-year-old music icon recently opened up for an interview with Oprah Winfrey, where he revealed that he plans to permanently relocate to Ghana, a country in western Africa.

"I want to see this nation smile again and I want to see it before I leave ... to move to Ghana," the singer said in a clip published by Punch Newspapers. "Because I'm going to do that."

When asked by Winfrey if he's planning to move permanently, Wonder responded: "I am."

STEVIE WONDER GIVES FANS HEALTH UPDATE AFTER KIDNEY TRANSPLANT: 'MY VOICE FEELS GREAT'

"I don't want to see my children's children's children have to say, 'Oh, please like me, please, please respect me, please know that I'm important, please value me,'" he explained.

In 1994, the "Superstition" singer told a Washington gathering of the International Association of African American Music that he had grown fond of Ghana while visiting.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, he said he feels that "there's more of a sense of community there."

Wonder was born in Michigan in 1950 and grew up to become a Motown music star and pioneer despite being blind.

STEVIE WONDER CALLS ON JOE BIDEN, KAMALA HARRIS TO ESTABLISH A TRUTH COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE INEQUALITY

For his work, he's earned 25 Grammys and 74 nominations total. He also won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the song "I Just Called to Say I Love You," which was used in the film "The Woman in Red."

The star underwent a health ordeal a little over a year ago, telling viewers at a news conference last year that he was "blessed with a new kidney" in December 2019.

"Since I have been released from the hospital, the nurses have made sure I’ve taken my medicine on time and I’m going to do it for as long as I have to, even if it is the rest of my life. I feel great. My voice feels great," he said at the October conference, according to The Associated Press. "I feel like I’m about 40 right now and I just thank everyone for the prayers and the love."

The Associated Press and Fox News' Tyler McCarthy contributed to this reportPresident Biden’s first month in the White House has already shown him to be a "detriment" to the nation, and "it's only the beginning," former Trump campaign senior adviser Lara Trump told Fox News' "Hannity" Wednesday.

"I think there’s going to be more disappointment for so many people under a Biden presidency," said the former president's daughter-in-law.

Lara Trump cited Biden putting 11,000 Americans out of work during his first week in office by signing the executive order to shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline project. By contrast, the Trump administration saw the U.S. become a net energy exporter for the first time.

Aside from the increase in jobs energy independence brought to America, Trump noted the addition benefit of ending America's reliance on foreign oil from places like the Middle East and Russia.

TRUMP, AT CPAC, EXPECTED TO HAMMER BIDEN ON IMMIGRATION, CHINA

On Wednesday, authorities in Dallas announced her arrest in connection with the murder, according to reports.

Jennifer Faith was arrested on obstruction of justice allegations a month after her ex-boyfriend, Darrin Lopez, was arrested in the Oct. 9 killing of James Faith, FOX 4 in Dallas reported. Police said Lopez drove from his home in Tennessee to Dallas to carry out the murder.

Jennifer Faith, 48, allegedly told police earlier that she couldn’t identify the shooter because he approached them from behind and wore a face mask.

Investigators later alleged that she and Lopez were involved in a "full-blown emotional affair," as she put it to a friend, and were exchanging hundreds of texts a day, according to information obtained from a search warrant, according to FOX 4.

She and Lopez allegedly discussed how they could be together in five years in their 14,000 texts in the month that included the murder, but suddenly stopped texting the day of the shooting and resumed a day later.

Jennifer Faith continued to text Lopez even after she told a friend she had stopped the affair because it "hurt" her husband.

Jennifer Faith was booked into the Dallas County jail Wednesday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Lopez is also being held in the Dallas County jail with bail set at $1 million, the Dallas Morning News reported.

Her attorney, Toby Shook, didn’t comment on the arrest but previously said that she is innocent.

"Jennifer was devastated by the murder of her husband. She has cooperated with the police the past three months and met with them on numerous occasions and answered all their questions," he told WFAA-TV in Dallas.

Soon after her husband’s killing, she told FOX 4 it was hard not knowing why he was killed. She pleaded for her husband’s killer to turn himself in. "It’s been horrible, devastating. I teeter between being heartbroken and completely devastated. Every day has been awful," she said at the time. The couple had been married for 15 years.Democrats are wrong to argue that Sen. Joe Manchin's opposition to the nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget stems from bigotry, Laura Ingraham said Wednesday.

"Manchin's decision wasn’t arbitrary, it was sensible," began "The Ingraham Angle" host. "Tanden, like so many other Biden Cabinet and sub-Cabinet picks ... is an obscenely stupid and polarizing choice. A venomous hack, Tanden has sprayed conservatives, including sitting U.S. senators, with gratuitous and groundless attacks. She is also a conspiracy theorist and Russia hoax super-spreader."

Ingraham played several clips in which cable news hosts alleged that the West Virginia Democrat's opposition to Tanden is because she is a woman and a person of color

"Why not just defend the nomination on substantive grounds?" Ingraham asked. "I can tell you why. Because Tanden's qualifications are really flimsy, that's why. Raising money for left-wing causes and attacking Republicans on the internet hardly qualifies you to run the Office of Management and Budget."

MEDIA PUNDITS CLAIM OPPOSITION TO NEERA TANDEN IS DUE TO BIGOTRY

The context of the controversy, Ingraham claimed, that Democrats are terrified by the prospect "that come November 2022, they and their job-killing policies are going to be exposed, that millions of voters will decide they want their freedom back, and that all of the radical nonsense Biden's team pushed failed spectacularly. Which, of course, it will."

"Democrats," Ingraham went on, "are making huge mistakes by vilifying people like Manchin, while elevating hard-core radicals like Tanden. Biden is going to find out the hard way that voters, they didn't give him a mandate to remake America. His only mandate was maybe to deal with COVID and reopen America. And we know Dr. Fauci isn't about to let that happen anytime soon … Republicans will be there every step of the way to remind those voters of the party that kept them locked down and which party wanted then to be free."

As for Manchin, the host noted, Democrats "patronize and humor" him when they need his vote ... at this point, it's just obvious that they simply hate him, and they hate his constituents, as well. Imagine ... being a member in a club that detests you and the people closest to you. I can't, either."After listening to Dr. Anthony Fauci suggest last weekend that we should expect to be wearing two masks on our faces everywhere we go until the end of 2022, I began thinking again about first principles.

Fauci is entitled to express his opinions. Yet, because he is the president’s chief adviser on COVID-related medical matters, I cringed when I heard what he said. Was this a trial balloon or did he mean it literally? Are these suggestions or will they become commands with the purported force of law?

Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, it governs the government wherever it goes and whatever it does. The original purpose of the Constitution was twofold: to establish the federal government and to limit its regulatory and taxing powers to the 17 discrete powers articulated in Article I.

The former took place in 1789 when the Constitution was ratified. The latter has been a dismal failure.

MEGHAN MCCAIN CONTINUES TO BASH DR. FAUCI OVER ‘INCREDIBLY INCONSISTENT AND CONFUSING’ CORONAVIRUS MESSAGING

The federal government recognizes next to no limits to its powers, no matter which political party controls Congress and the White House. The feds believe that they can right any wrong, tax any event and regulate any behavior -- subject only to the express prohibitions in the Constitution. Even when there is a prohibition, such as, "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech," Congress has found ways around it. To the federal government, "no law" does not mean "no law." Just ask the folks who have been prosecuted for their speech.

This is known as the Wilsonian model, named after President Woodrow Wilson, who advanced it shamelessly. All of his presidential successors have done the same.

Before Wilson, for the most part, and except for the Civil War years, the federal government recognized the limitations imposed upon it by the Constitution and, for the most part, stayed within their confines. This is known as the Madisonian model, named after President James Madison who wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

The first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights articulate negative rights. That is, the amendments don’t grant rights; they restrain the government from interfering with rights that already existed when the amendments were ratified. The Fifth and the 14th Amendments expressly require that the government prove fault and harm at a jury trial before it can interfere with property rights.

The Ninth Amendment commands that the enumeration of certain rights in the first eight amendments nevertheless does not negate other rights retained by the people, and the government shall not "deny or disparage" those other rights. Among those other rights that the government shall not deny or disparage are those that affect property ownership.

FAUCI DOWNPLAYS CONCERNS OVER COVID-19 VARIANTS, BUT CLAIMS VARIANT VACCINES IN DEVELOPMENT

All property not owned by the government confers upon its owners what lawyers call the "bundle" of property rights. The bundle includes the right to use the property, to alienate the property -- sell, lease, encumber and to exclude others from the property, even the government -- as the owner sees fit. The bundle represents the natural rights that property ownership confers upon owners.

The government does not enjoy the rights contained in the bundle. You can exclude me from your garden party because I am Catholic or a libertarian. The government cannot do so from its property for the same reasons. The bundle represents natural rights, which are enjoyed only by natural people. The government is not a natural person. It is an artificial construct based on a monopoly of force in a geographic area.

Yet, today, the government tells us what we can and cannot do on our property, regulates and taxes the use of our property and comes onto our property under all sorts of pretexts. Stated differently, the government does care about property rights and it denies and disparages them regularly -- the Fifth, Ninth and 14th Amendments notwithstanding.

Among the property rights that the government has lately denied is the ownership of our bodies. As our rights are natural -- they are integral to our humanity -- we are born with the ownership of our bodies, a right that ripens as we achieve adulthood. The Supreme Court has recognized the right to make personal private decisions about our bodies and immunized those decisions from ordinary governmental assault.

So, when the government tells us what clothing we must minimally wear, under the Constitution, it must mean on property that it owns, not on private property. Yet, even on government property, the Constitution protects us.

What about your face? As you own your body, you own your face.

Decisions about what your face looks like are protected by substantive due process. Stated differently, these private personal decisions -- to shave or not, to wear makeup or not, to bare the face or not -- are essentially immune from government regulation, absent a showing of fault and harm.

The government can dispatch its medical personnel to persuade us to do as the government wishes -- despite neglecting a substantial body of medical evidence that contradicts what it preaches -- but it may not use the force of law to compel compliance on the face.

The whole purpose of the Bill of Rights is to keep the government off the people’s backs, as Justice William O. Douglas famously wrote. He could have written "faces."

There are areas of human behavior that are none of the government’s business. Facial appearance -- because we own our faces and can exclude all others, even the government, from them -- is foremost among them.

History teaches that governments crave control and resist restraint. They negate liberty. Yet, according to the Declaration of Independence, the reason we have government is not to tell us how to live but to protect our freedoms. How well has that worked?

"Mercia was loved immensely and will be missed greatly, as she joins the legion of angels who have gone home too soon due to the pandemic," she said.

The state’s Department of Public Safety on Tuesday released recordings of investigators questioning Jason Ravnsborg about the Sept. 12 crash that left 55-year-old Joseph Boever dead.

The footage shows how, during a Sept. 14 interview, detectives told Ravnsborg that they had discovered a pair of broken glasses on the front passenger floorboard of his vehicle.

During a second sit-down on Sept. 30, interviewers asked about the glasses again, telling Ravnsborg that they had belonged to the victim.

SOUTH DAKOTA AG RAVNSBORG , WHO ALLEGEDLY FATALLY STRUCK MAN WITH CAR, ESCAPES FELONY CHARGES

"They’re Joe’s glasses," an agent says, referring to Boever. "So that means his face came through your windshield."

Upon hearing that, Ravnsborg looked down and sighed deeply, before shaking his head, the footage shows.

"I did not see those glasses until you showed them to me," he said.

The agent told Ravnsborg that "the only way for them to get there is through the windshield."

"His face was in your windshield, Jason. Think about that."

Ravnsborg maintained that he hadn’t seen the glasses until investigators showed them to him — and that he truly didn’t realize he’d hit a person at the time of the crash.

"I did not see him. I did not see anything," Ravnsborg insisted. "I did not know it was a human until the next day."

An investigator replied that: "You think you had an idea it was something other than a deer, though?"

"I just believed it was a deer." Ravnsborg replied. "I do."

COUSIN OF SOUTH DAKOTA MAN KILLED IN CRASH INVOLVING STATE AG SEEKING ANSWERS, JUSTICE

After the crash, Ravnsborg told authorities that he thought he had plowed his 2011 Ford Taurus into a deer or another large animal as he drove on US Highway 14 at about 10:30 p.m.

He was on his way home from a GOP fundraiser at Rooster’s Bar and Grill, where attendees were offered the chance to win a handgun engraved with then-President Trump’s name, according to the South Dakota GOP’s website.

The 44-year-old Republican was charged in the incident last week and faces three counts of careless driving, operating a motor vehicle while using a mobile electronic device and veering out of his lane.

Authorities said the evidence didn’t support more serious felony raps, and that Ravnsborg was not intoxicated at the time of the incident.

Ravnsborg, who was elected to his first term in 2018, was distracted when he swerved into Boever, who was walking on the highway’s shoulder, according to crash investigators.

South Dakota House lawmakers began impeachment proceedings against Ravnsborg on Tuesday, following the release of the interviews and other investigative materials.

Lawmakers argued in the impeachment resolution that Ravnsborg should be removed from office for "his crimes or misdemeanors in office causing the death" of Boever.

Gov. Kristi Noem, also a Republican, called for Ravnsborg to resign shortly before the impeachment resolution was filed.

"Now that the investigation has closed and charges have been filed, I believe the Attorney General should resign," she tweeted. "I have reviewed the material we are releasing, starting today, and I encourage others to review it as well."

But Ravnsborg’s will not be stepping down, according to his spokesman Mike Deaver.

"As an attorney and a Lt. Colonel in the Army Reserves, AG Ravnsborg has fought for the rule of law and personal liberties and would hope that he is afforded the same right and courtesy," Deaver said in a statement.In an opinion article published online Thursday, a top liberal columnist for The New York Times blamed Democrats for the harm being inflicted on millions of the nation’s children by a year of school closures – describing it as a "tragedy we haven’t adequately confronted."

Writer Nicholas Kristof also suggests that many Democrats may have been blinded by animus toward former President Trump when they enacted the coronavirus-related school shutdowns.

"Many Democrats seemed to be more suspicious of in-person schooling last summer when President Donald Trump called for it," he writes, adding, "We shouldn’t let ourselves be driven by ideology rather than science."

"We shouldn’t let ourselves be driven by ideology rather than science." — Nicholas Kristof, New York Times

He notes that at least one Democrat, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, pushed for schools to reopen in her state, "and kids there are better off because she did."

CALIFORNIA CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR ACCUSES NEWSOM OF CREATING 'EDUCATION EQUALITY GAP' DURING COVID

Elsewhere, however, millions of the nation’s schoolchildren have missed in-person learning for many months because of coronavirus mitigation policies, a situation that may result in "permanent damage" -- both to the children and the nation’s future, Kristof writes.

"The blunt fact," he continues, "is that it is Democrats – including those who run the West Coast, from California through Oregon to Washington State – who have presided over one of the worst blows to the education of disadvantaged Americans in history."

"It is Democrats ... who have presided over one of the worst blows to the education of disadvantaged Americans in history." — Nicholas Kristof, New York Times

He also blames Democratic governors and mayors, saying they "too often let schools stay closed even as bars opened."

Kristof then cites some of the latest findings from organizations that have been tracking the impact of school closures.

Pandemic-related disruptions to schooling could increase the nation’s high school dropout rate by nearly 4 percent, Kristof writes, citing an estimate from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. The repercussions will likely mean fewer college-educated workers in the nation’s labor force and lower incomes for employees, he adds.

The disruptions also will likely worsen the achievement gap between children from wealthier families – those that can afford private schooling and home internet service, for example – and those from low-income families, who often lack internet and cellphone service, Kristof notes.

As many as 3 million American children have had no schooling – whether in the classroom or online – for the better part of a year, Kristof adds, sharing findings from the nonprofit Bellwether Education Partners.

He also argues that teachers who oppose returning to the classroom until after all teachers and students are vaccinated are guilty of "an abdication of responsibility to America’s children."

Kristof writes that evidence from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the British Medical Journal and a Tulane University study all suggest that in-person schooling doesn’t pose any dangerous risks to students or teachers.

The Times columnist’s position mirrors that of many parents around the country.

In Los Angeles, some parents organized what they called a "Zoom blackout," demanding that they have more say in when schools reopen.

In New Jersey, some parents held a rally Monday, calling for their school district and the local teachers union to reach a deal on resuming in-person classes.

"It's been almost 350 days since most kids have seen the inside of a classroom. We know this: Virtual ‘learning’ is not working," SOMA for Safe Return to School, the organizers of the rally outside the town hall in Maplewood, wrote on Facebook. "Schools do not have to be closed to be safe."

Kristof of the Times has previously written in support of having schools reopen.

In November, he penned a column titled, "When Trump Was Right and Many Democrats Wrong."

"Some things are true even though President Trump says them," Kristof began. "Trump has been demanding for months that schools reopen, and on that he seems to have been largely right. Schools, especially elementary schools, do not appear to have been major sources of coronavirus transmission, and remote learning is proving to be a catastrophe for many low-income children."A New York lawmaker took to Twitter late Wednesday to call for an independent investigation into sexual harassment allegations leveled against the state’s embattled governor.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo was accused by a former aide, Lindsey Boylan, of orchestrating a "pervasive" culture of "sexual harassment and bullying." She posted on Medium that Cuomo once suggested that they play "strip poker" during a flight in October 2017 and said he once kissed her on the lips.

CUOMO RAISES EYEBROWS WITH 'ANATOMY' JOKE DURING VACCINATION TOUR

"The idea that someone might think I held my high-ranking position because of the Governor’s ‘crush’ on me was more demeaning than the kiss itself," she posted.

Boylan, a Democrat running for Manhattan borough president, said that during her more than three years in the Democrat’s administration, Cuomo "would go out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs."

Cuomo’s office denied the allegations as "simply false."

Assemblywoman Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, a Democrat from Queens, called the allegations "abhorrent and heartbreaking."

MOST NEW YORKERS SAY CUOMO MISHANDLED CORONAVIRUS IN NURSING HOMES, POLL FINDS

"We must hold even the highest officials of our state accountable if we expect to restore the public’s trust," she posted. She also called for new legislation to discourage harassment.

Boyland attributed her decision to say more to Assemblyman Ron Kim, another Democrat, who levied public accusations of bullying and threats from Cuomo and his aides last week.

Fox News' Thomas Barrabi and the Associated Press contributed to this reportHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-ranking House GOP member, had an uncomfortable exchange with reporters Wednesday over whether former President Trump should speak at CPAC as planned this weekend.

"Yes, he should," McCarthy said in a brief response after being asked by a reporter.

Cheney, however, had a different answer when asked the same question.

"That’s up to CPAC," she began, before elaborating. "I’ve been clear about my views of President Trump and the extent to which, following Jan. 6., I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country."

LIZ CHENEY IN DONALD TRUMP JR.'S 2022 CROSSHAIRS

After a moment of awkward silence, McCarthy concluded the press conference. "On that high note, thank you all very much," he said to laughter from reporters.

Cheney roiled the party last month when she voted to impeach Trump and Trump-aligned congress members like Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., soon jgcalled for her ouster from House leadership.

MATT GAETZ TARGETS HOUSE LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY FOR DEFENDING LIZ CHENEY

Cheney was censured by Republicans in her home state of Wyoming and Donald Trump Jr., Gaetz and others have vowed to support challengers who plan to primary her.

But 145 members of the House Republican Conference ended up backing Cheney, with just 61 Trump loyalists voting to remove her from her leadership role during a secret ballot vote earlier this month.

And Cheney has remained defiant in her continued criticism of the former president who remains popular in the party.

"Those of us who care deeply about our history and our future, who take our oaths and our obligations seriously, will steer our party and our nation into the future," she told the Reagan Institute Tuesday. "We will right the unforgivable wrongs of Jan. 6. We will make our party worthy, once again, of the mantle of Lincoln and Reagan."

McCarthy has backed Cheney but remains supportive of Trump, even visiting the former president at Mar-a-Lago to discuss getting the House back in GOP control in 2022.

Fox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.Buffalo schools have adopted a curriculum that pushes the controversial idea that all White people perpetuate systemic racism, while 80% of its students fail to reach proficiency in reading and writing, an editor said Wednesday.

City Journal editor Chris Rufo, during an appearance on "The Ingraham Angle," said the "diversity czar" of Buffalo public schools was caught on tape saying she believes that America's sickness leads some White people to believe Black people are less than human.

One of the district's instructional materials also includes the assertion that "all White people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism."

He said the narrative of system racism has also spread to schools across the country, which shifts attention away from "their own abysmal failure to educate kids."

BUFFALO'S SCHOOL DISTRICT TELLS STUDENTS THAT 'ALL WHITE PEOPLE PLAY A PART IN PERPETUATING SYSTEMIC RACISM'

"Woke academics and educators are transforming schools away from academics and education and into politics," he told host Laura Ingraham.

"It's certainly giving kids a sense that America is an awful rotten racist place -- at the very least," Ingraham said.

"You can absolutely see it at every stage of the curriculum," Rufo replied. "The lesson plans teach that America is a fundamentally racist place."

CONNECTICUT GIRLS LOSE SUPPORT FROM BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IN TRANSGENDER ATHLETE CASE

Rufo added that schools are also trying to teach "critical consciousness" an idea that students should be trained to identify and overthrow oppressors.

"In this case the United States of America," Rufo continued."The country is looking for action."

That’s the internal message from one of President Biden’s top advisers.

But is the country looking for the particular actions he’s pushing?

The Republicans have made it increasingly clear they will oppose his Covid relief package as too unfocused and expensive, and that the Democrats will push it through on a party-line vote. While even some liberal economists see the $1.9-trillion price tag as too high, the package is polling well, and a new president usually gets his first big initiative. So this is, to use the technical term, a no-brainer.

But could it be tough slogging for Biden after that?

The memo from White House senior adviser Mike Donilon, first reported by Axios, seems to move beyond Biden’s campaign talk of unity. The idea is to stick it to the GOP.

"There seems to be a growing conventional wisdom that it is either politically smart – or, at worst, cost-free – for the GOP to adopt an obstructionist, partisan, base-politics posture," Donilon writes. "However, there is lots of evidence that the opposite is true: that it isn’t politically smart for the GOP to be going down this road. And rather than being cost-free, this approach has been quite damaging to them."

BACKLASH BREWING AS BIDEN, FAUCI KEEP URGING COVID CAUTION

That remains to be seen. I do think Republicans may pay a price for opposing bigger stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, small business subsidies and school reopening assistance. If the vaccination program (which now looks to include Johnson & Johnson) succeeds and the economy booms, no one will remember what legislative maneuvers the administration had to use.

But legislative opposition does work, if only because it’s so easy to stop something on the Hill. Mitch McConnell may be backing Merrick Garland for attorney general, but he’s largely responsible for Garland not being on the Supreme Court and Amy Comey Barrett being a new justice.

"The animating spirit behind the administration’s approach is impatience — born of the pandemic, the looming midterms and Mr. Biden’s own bitter experiences with Republicans during President Barack Obama’s administration," says the New York Times. That, you may recall, is when McConnell vowed to make Obama a one-term president. (That didn’t work out so well.)

But one-party governance is hard. The Biden team may not get much cooperation on immigration, to be sure, but also on such issues as infrastructure without a greater willingness to compromise with the other side.

And the Democrats don’t have the strongest hand with a 50-50 Senate. The upper chamber has always been a place where every member has a nuclear weapon, and that’s even more true now that moderate Joe Manchin can single-handedly stop Neera Tanden’s nomination to OMB as long as Republicans hold ranks. (Whether the GOP has the standing to yell about her mean tweets, after four years of Donald Trump’s Twitter attacks, is another question, but Tanden did dig herself a deep hole.)

Two other nominees, Xavier Becerra and Deb Haaland, are also drawing flak.

Biden has resisted caving to the left wing of his party. The former candidate who refused to back Medicare for All has also rejected liberal demands that the government forgive up to $50,000 in student loan debt. He has also signaled that the $15 minimum wage, part of the Covid aid bill, will probably have to be removed, and that he is open to a slower wage hike.

But the Democrats, after all, opposed most of what Trump wanted to do. Every time the White House or Congress changes hands, it seems to be payback time. For all of Biden’s longtime relationships with Republican lawmakers, he may find that Beltway gridlock is the one beast he cannot slay.The Oklahoma football player who nearly lost an eye in a bar fight this month had it coming, according to the other side.

A 58-second video that went viral last week captured the moment Brown, a junior at the school and trained wrestler and mixed martial arts fighter, landed multiple punches and put Jones in a chokehold.

Jones, a redshirt senior, underwent a four-hour procedure to rebuild his left orbital socket following the fracas, according to The Athletic.

Police are investigating the incident, which reportedly took place in the early hours of Feb. 14.

No arrests have been made.

The video begins with Jones telling Brown to "get the f–k out of here."

Brown was then shoved by someone standing next to Jones. Seconds later, Brown wiped blood from his face and struck Jones.

"There was something that occurred prior to the start of the video as my nose doesn’t bleed for no reason," he wrote on a GoFundMe page aimed at helping pay his medical expenses.

Brown tore his bicep, according to the page, which has raised $35,745.

Woodrow Glass, an attorney representing Jones, said his client was "trying to de-escalate the situation," and that the blood on Brown’s face wasn’t caused by Jones.

Glass said Jones went to the bathroom to check on his friend, when he ended up in the middle of an argument.

The video also showed Brown’s brother, Braden, fighting another man in the bathroom.

Braden Brown, who is also a student at Oklahoma, tweeted Saturday that he and his brother have "been wrestling since we were in diapers and MMA/Cage Fighting since we were 12. They gave us no options unfortunately. We showed restraint."Tiger Woods will likely face a lengthy recovery following his near-fatal car crash in Los Angeles this week, experts have said.

Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer and interim chief executive of Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, outlined Woods’ "significant injuries to his right lower extremity" in a statement that was posted to the golfer’s Twitter account Wednesday.

Mahajan said the injuries were treated "during emergency surgery by orthopedic trauma specialists." Woods suffered "open fractures affecting both the upper and lower portions of the tibia and fibula bones" that had to be stabilized by inserting a rod in his tibia.

He added that additional bone injuries to his foot and ankle were "stabilized with a combination of screws and pins. Trauma to the muscle and soft-tissue of the leg required surgical release of the covering of the muscles to relieve pressure due to swelling."

TIGER WOODS TO AVOID RECKLESS DRIVING CHARGE IN CRASH, LOS ANGELES SHERIFF SAYS

Dr. William Stetson, team surgeon for USA men's and women's volleyball who is not treating Woods, told KABC-TV in Los Angeles Woods’ recovery will likely be a slow process.

"Typically with injuries like that, patients are not allowed to bear any weight on it for the first four to six weeks," he said. "You probably won't be able to put a full amount of weight on it until maybe three months after the surgery."

And he said it would likely be between nine months to a year "for or any sort of decent recovery from an injury like that."

He added that infection is a primary concern because Woods had an "open" fracture, meaning the bone broke through the skin, and the golfer will probably have to undergo additional surgeries in the next few months to stave off infection.

TIGER WOODS WAS UNAWARE OF 'HOW GRAVELY HE WAS INJURED' IMMEDIATELY AFTER WRECK, DEPUTY SAYS

Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Kenneth Jung, of the Kerlan-Jobe Institute and isn’t involved in Woods' treatment, told the Los Angeles Times injuries to the right foot are common in crashes like Woods’ because the driver is attempting to brake with the right foot while the left is off to the side.

He said if Woods injured his Lisfranc joint complex in the middle of the foot, which is common in car accidents, it could lead to arthritis.

"That would raise concern in my mind not just with golf but going forward in life," he told the Times. "That would manifest as pain and stiffness in the joints of the foot."

Dr. Gregory Tennant, another orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser Permanente, agreed Woods likely wouldn’t be "up and walking around for a while" especially since he recently underwent back surgery before the crash.

"Trauma is never truly an isolated event," Tennant said. "It is not uncommon to identify injuries — even significant injuries — days later, as the initial high-energy injuries are dealt with."

Stetson said he has seen other elite athletes compete again after severe injuries and he wouldn’t count Woods out.

"He just has a long, long, long road ahead of him and so I would just ask everybody be patient with him and say some prayers for him," he told KABC.

But not this year.

Flu has virtually disappeared from the U.S., with reports coming in at far lower levels than anything seen in decades.

CLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS

Experts say that measures put in place to fend off the coronavirus — mask wearing, social distancing and virtual schooling — were a big factor in preventing a "twindemic" of flu and COVID-19. A push to get more people vaccinated against flu probably helped, too, as did fewer people traveling, they say.

Flu-related hospitalizations, however, are a small fraction of where they would stand during even a very mild season, said Brammer, who oversees the CDC’s tracking of the virus.

Flu death data for the whole U.S. population is hard to compile quickly, but CDC officials keep a running count of deaths of children. One pediatric flu death has been reported so far this season, compared with 92 reported at the same point in last year’s flu season.

"Many parents will tell you that this year their kids have been as healthy as they’ve ever been, because they’re not swimming in the germ pool at school or day care the same way they were in prior years," Mick said.

Some doctors say they have even stopped sending specimens for testing, because they don’t think flu is present. Nevertheless, many labs are using a CDC-developed "multiplex test" that checks specimens for both the coronavirus and flu, Brammer said.

More than 190 million flu vaccine doses were distributed this season, but the number of infections is so low that it’s difficult for CDC to do its annual calculation of how well the vaccine is working, Brammer said. There’s simply not enough data, she said.

That also is challenging the planning of next season’s flu vaccine. Such work usually starts with checking which flu strains are circulating around the world and predicting which of them will likely predominate in the year ahead.

"But there’s not a lot of (flu) viruses to look at," Brammer said.YEREVAN, Armenia — Armenia's prime minister spoke of an attempted military coup Thursday after the military's General Staff demanded that he step down after months of protests sparked by the nation's defeat in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Azerbaijan.

The General Staff issued a statement calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, which was signed by top military officers. The move was triggered by Pashinyan's decision earlier this week to oust the first deputy chief of the General Staff.

Pashinyan described the military's statement as a "military coup attempt" and ordered the firing of the General Staff's chief. He urged the military to only listen to his orders and called on his supporters to come to the streets to back him.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES NEW ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN CONFLICT CEASEFIRE BROKERED BY US

Meanwhile, throngs of opposition demonstrators swarmed the streets of the Armenian capital, chanting "Nikol, you traitor!" and "Nikol, resign!"

Opposition supporters blocked the streets around Yerevan, paralyzing traffic all around the capital.

The quick-paced developments came after Armenia saw a spike in demonstrations this week demanding that Pashinyan step down.

Protests calling for Pashinyan's resignation began immediately after he signed the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces.

Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.

Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 6,000 people on both sides.

Despite the simmering public anger over the military defeat, Pashinyan has maneuvered to shore up his rule and the protests died down amid the winter's cold. But the opposition demonstrations resumed with new vigor this week, and the spat between Pashinyan and the top military commanders has weakened his position.

Pashinyan fired the deputy chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Tiran Khachatryan, earlier this week after he derided the prime minister's claim that just 10% of Russia-supplied Iskander missiles that Armenia used in the conflict exploded on impact.

The General Staff responded Thursday with a statement demanding Pashinyan's resignation and warned the government against trying to use force against the opposition demonstrators. Immediately after the statement, Pashinyan fired the General Staff chief, Col. Gen. Onik Gasparyan.There was no fanfare. No iconic announcement.

An Australian push to host the 2032 Olympics was elevated overnight to the status of preferred bid, and the people of Brisbane and southeast Queensland state woke up to the news on Thursday morning.

It’s not a done deal yet, but powerful Olympic official John Coates is vowing to get it across the finish line when the IOC makes the final call, which could be within 12 months.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM

"It was a long night . . . but a very mature decision from the IOC. To take a decision when you’ve still got a few other cities there and say ‘well, we’re going to go into targeted dialogue with one preferred city’ was a big call by them," Coates said Thursday. "The IOC now deal exclusively with us while we complete the questionnaire. The other cities who have shown interest have been parked . . . it’s significant recognition."

I OC president Thomas Bach told a news conference in Switzerland on Wednesday that an IOC panel overseeing the bid process would begin "targeted dialogue" with Australian organizers.

The 2032 contest was expected to include Doha, Qatar, and Budapest, Hungary, which withdrew late from the 2024 contest to pave the way for Los Angeles being offered the 2028 Olympics. China, Germany, India, Indonesia and Russia were also working on possible bids for 2032.

Coates is a long-serving president of the Australian Olympic Committee, a vice president of the International Olympic Committee, the head of the coordination commission which assesses preparation for the Tokyo Games and an architect of the new process the IOC uses to select host cities.

He was heavily involved in Australia's successful bid and running of the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

Melbourne hosted the 1956 Olympics and Coates has said for several years that Brisbane, Australia's third-biggest city, would be next in line among the country's contenders.

He said the IOC has reviewed plans and various feasibility studies and now the "federal government has to provide its undertakings in terms of security, things that’s done for any international event that comes here, border control, all of those things. So there’s work to be done in that area."

The government leader of Queensland state, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the decision puts Queensland "in the box seat" and she was confident that the federal, state and municipal governments were "absolutely united in working together to make this happen."

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the bid during a meeting in Japan last year with IOC president Thomas Bach, and Palaszczuk had meetings with the IOC in Switzerland.

Palaszczuk said Brisbane and surrounding cities to the north, south and west already had 85% of the venues required for the games and that was the "gamechanger" as the IOC seeks to cut the costs of hosting the games.

"We don’t have to build huge stadiums that are not going to be used in the future, and this gives hope and opportunity as we got through our economic recovery and plan for the future," she said.

Organizers could either build a new, 50,000-seat main stadium for the opening ceremony and track and field competition, or upgrade one of the region's existing stadiums. The other main construction would be a 15,000-seat aquatic center, although there's existing facilities in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast that could be upgraded.

Brisbane hosted the Commonwealth Games in 1982, the World Expo in 1988, the G20 Summit in 2014 and the Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games, using facilities across the region.

A conference of mayors spanning from the Gold Coast to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland's southeast corner has been working for six years on planning the bid. It has a proposed budget of $4.5 billion but organizers say the cost to taxpayers would be minimized by the IOC’s contribution plus sponsorship and ticketing revenue.

"When we started this journey . . . many people were skeptical. Now we’re one step away from being named as the host of the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games," Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said. "Today is not the time to get over-excited, there is still plenty of work to be done."Tim Allen's character Mike Baxter and his on-screen wife in "Last Man Standing" are at odds with each other.

Cuomo allegations ‘abhorrent and heartbreaking,’ require independent probe, New York state Democrat says

A Democrat serving in the New York state Assembly joined the chorus of criticism against Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday, calling for an independent investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and bullying against the governor.

Assemblywoman Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, a Democrat from the Queens borough of New York City, called the allegations "abhorrent and heartbreaking."

"We must hold even the highest officials of our state accountable if we expect to restore the public’s trust," Gonzalez-Rojas wrote on social media. She also called for new legislation to discourage harassment.

Earlier in the week, a former Cuomo aide, Lindsey Boylan, accused the Democrat of orchestrating a "pervasive" culture of "sexual harassment and bullying." She posted on Medium that Cuomo once suggested that they play "strip poker" during a flight in October 2017 and said he once kissed her on the lips.

Cuomo’s office has denied the allegations as "simply false." CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.

John Kerry’s meetings with Iran blasted as ‘appalling,’ ‘reckless,’ ‘irresponsible’

A report alleging possible collusion between Biden administration climate czar John Kerry and Iran’s foreign minister drew sharp criticism Wednesday from retired U.S. Army Gen. Jack Keane during an interview with Fox News.

Kerry had meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during the Trump administration that were intended to help undermine the Trump presidency, a Washington Times report claimed. Kerry had served as U.S. secretary of state under former President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017, succeeding Hillary Clinton in the position.

"In terms of what Secretary Kerry was doing and other members of the Biden administration, in my judgment is appalling and it’s reckless and significantly irresponsible," Gen. Keane, now the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, told Fox News.

"What we’re not used to is previous government officials actually colluding and talking to our enemies, and I emphasize enemy because that is who Iran really is. In the past 40 years, there is no nation-state that has killed more Americans than Iran," the retired general said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.

Trump, at CPAC, expected to hammer Biden on immigration, China

Former President Donald Trump will hammer President Biden on everything from immigration to China when he addresses CPAC (Conservative Political Action Committee) on Sunday, sources familiar with the speech told Fox News.

Trump is expected to fall just short of announcing a 2024 presidential bid. The sources said he will go between "warming up to the idea of a 2024 run, and walking right up to the line of announcing another campaign" -- though he is not expected to make an actual announcement.

The former president will be the headline speaker at the event in Orlando, Fla., which kicks off Thursday. Trump will speak on the final day of the conference, topping a slew of conservatives and Republicans from across the country.

It will be Trump’s first public appearance since leaving office and comes as Biden has taken a number of actions to undo his predecessor's policies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.

SOME PARTING WORDS

Tucker Carlson argued Wednesday night that Democrats plan to welcome more illegal aliens into the U.S. as part of a broader goal of expanding their voter base.

"A month before last year's presidential election," Carlson said on "Tucker Carlson Tonight," "Joe Biden promised: ‘Within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people, and all of those so-called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship.

"Joe Biden is in the White House now. His party controls everything," Carlson continued, "so he can make good on that promise and he plans to do so. In fact, it's one of the very first things he's doing. How's it going to affect you?"

We’ll see you in your inbox first thing Friday.An Instagram influencer with over 500,000 followers has responded to criticism of her recent photo shoot, which pictures her lying naked atop an endangered Sumatran elephant in Bali.

Alesya Kafelnikova, 22, originally shared a video from the shoot to Instagram on Feb. 13, according to The Sun. A few days later, she uploaded another photo of herself with the elephant, along with a caption reading, "to love nature is human nature."

But among the many fans who liked Kafelnikova’s photo, a number of critics took issue with the influencer staging her shoot with a critically endangered animal that was likely transported to Bali for tourism purposes — including an advocacy group campaigning to save Asian elephants.

"Yet another tragic trivialization of the majestic Asian elephant when the species is fighting for its very existence against brutal abuse in tourism and human 'entertainment,’" wrote Save the Asian Elephants (STAE) in a statement shared with The Sun. On Twitter, the group further decried Kagelnikova’s shoot as a "crude stunt to exploit and humiliate Asian elephants for commercial gain."

Bali’s Tourism Agency also chimed in, telling The Sun that Kafelnikova’s video "surely does not meet the norms that we are promoting as part of tourism in Bali."

A representative for the Bali Tourism Board was not immediately available to comment on the controversy for Fox News.

Kafelnikova, however, has since defended her photo in a later Instagram post, claiming that she performs charity work and donates money to support both the elephant and the people of the village where it lives. The influencer, also the daughter of Grand Slam-winning tennis champ Yevgeny Kafelnikov, added that she never meant to offend, and offered her apologies.

"It is a pity that people see this as vulgarity, and not as a beauty and love for nature," she wrote. "I love animals, I love elephants! And I love Bali so so much! I hope each of you will awaken an aesthetic love for my post and the beauty.

"It was a private photo shoot, I didn’t have a purpose to hurt the feelings of local people at all. We love Balinese culture and respect Indonesian rules. Please sorry if you see something else in this. My intention with these pictures was to show you that I love and respect animals and especially elephants more than anything."Three consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference road wins against teams in the lower half of the standings looked great, but perhaps not convincing, for North Carolina State.

It was at No. 15 Virginia on Wednesday night where they turned some heads.

DJ Funderburk scored nine of his 14 points in the second half and the Wolfpack opened a big lead and held off every challenge the Cavaliers had to offer in a 68-61 victory.

The road wins — at Boston College, Pittsburgh and Wake Forest — were sandwiched around home losses to Syracuse and Duke, and Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts praised his young team's ability to bounce back from adversity.

"I’ve asked them to grow up a little quicker than they needed to, but we’ve completely bought in," he said. "When you look at it, the ball moves from side to side, everybody’s playing their role, everybody is genuinely happy for one another.

"And typically you don’t get that in a team. And I think in order for us to be a really good basketball team, we don’t have that one guy on every night that can score 30 points."

Cam Hayes scored 16 points and Shakeel Moore had 12 for N.C. State (11-9, 7-8 ACC), which last won four ACC games in a row on the road in the last two games of 1980-81 season and the first two the following season.

Sam Hauser led Virginia with 21 points and Jay Huff had 19 points and 11 rebounds, but the Cavaliers (15-6, 11-4) lost their third straight for the first time since the 2016-17 season. They were outscored 30-16 in the paint, 17-6 off the bench and led for just 48 seconds.

The Cavaliers twice closed within five, the second time at 54-49 on Hauser’s third 3-pointer with 3:40 left, but Hayes barely beat the shot clock and banked in a desperation 3-pointer from the top of the key to push the lead back to eight.

Two free throws by Huff made it 57-53, and back-to-back 3s by Hauser brought them within 65-61 with 18 seconds left. But Dereon Seabron hit a free throw and Hayes hit two more to finish it off. NC State made 15 of its last 17 free-throw attempts.

Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett said it's common for teams to endure tough stretches, but "we haven’t become gritty enough or tough enough to lean on our defense to hold us in there. We did it a couple times this year, but not consistently enough," he said.

The Wolfpack led 17-4 after nine minutes, but Virginia used a 13-4 run to close within 25-21 two minutes before halftime. The Cavaliers took their first lead at 35-33 on two free throws by Huff with 14:31 remaining, capping a 12-4 spurt that started with consecutive 3-pointers by Hauser from in front of the Cavaliers' bench.

But N.C. State steadied itself, getting four points each from Manny Bates and Moore and a 3-pointer from Braxton Beverly as it scored 12 of the next 14 points.

The Cavaliers twice closed within five, the second time at 54-49 on Hauser's third 3-pointer with 3:40 left, but Hayes barely beat the shot clock and banked in a desperation 3-pointer from the top of the key to push the lead back to eight.

Hayes, a freshman, has now scored in double figures in three straight games after doing it just twice before.

BIG PICTURE

N.C. State: The Wolfpack are not known for being a lock-down defensive team, but for much of the first half, they combined smothering defense with hot shooting. N.C. State hit 9 of its first 13 shots in opening a 21-10 lead, but made just 3 of 12 the rest of the half.

Virginia: Facing a Wolfpack defense that was on them like Florida State had been in the Seminoles' 81-60 victory on Feb. 15, the Cavaliers trailed 17-4 after nine minutes and hit just five of their first 20 shots before getting a few to fall to close within 29-23 by halftime. They were 10 for 27 in the first half, 37%.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

The Wolfpack is surging and Virginia is headed in the opposite direction and struggling, but this loss won't look as bad on paper because of the way N.C. State has played of late.

Carli Lloyd, Kristie Mewis, Alex Morgan and Christen Press also scored, and the U.S. women also become the first team to have three straight shutouts in the SheBelieves Cup, which is in its sixth year.

The defending champion U.S. team blanked Canada in the round-robin tournament opener and then downed Brazil 2-0 on Sunday. Earlier Wednesday, Brazil beat Canada 2-0 at Exploria Stadium. Brazil finished second.

"Overall, very happy with how we performed and how were were able to unlock Argentina early in the game, and how we finished the game as well," U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski said.

Argentina, a late addition after Japan dropped out because of coronavirus concerns, did not win a match but did impress with gritty performances.

Rapinoe scored in the 16th minute with a well-timed strike on a through ball from Rose Lavelle for the early lead.

Rapinoe added another in the 26th minute, tapping in a cross from Lloyd. Rapinoe is the top SheBelieves career leader with seven goals, including three in this edition.

"We wanted to come out fast as always. It's always dangerous to leave teams hanging around, so we definitely didn't do that today," Rapinoe said. "Just tried to find the space, be aggressive."

Lloyd added a goal in the 34th. It was Lloyd's 124th international goal and it came in her 299th appearance with the national team.

Kristie Mewis scored on an angle into the far corner for her fourth career international goal in the 41st minute, and the United States took a 4-0 lead into the half.

Morgan scored in 84th, her first goal since giving birth to her daughter Charlie last May. It was her 108th international goal, moving her into sole possession of fifth place on the team's career list.

"I'm very excited to get my first goal back with the national team and join the list of moms on the team who have scored goals and played as a national team player," Morgan said. "I just want to be an example for other female athletes who are moms or want to become moms, knowing that they still belong in the game."

Press scored on a header before the final whistle for her 11th goal in her last 15 games.

Rose Lavelle was named the MVP for the tournament.

"Honestly I don't know how I won that," Lavelle said. "It's always nice to be recognized, but I think there were other people that deserved it more."

The United States improved to 4-0 against Argentina.Researchers studying COVID-19 and its variants across the U.S. have expressed concern over a mutation found in New York City that could diminish the effectiveness of vaccines on the virus.

The New York Times reported that researchers at Caltech and Columbia University studied the mutation, called B.1.526. One scientist told the paper he was more concerned about the variant in New York than the one in California.

The report said that the researchers found that E484K and S477N mutations present in more than a quarter of samples in the study.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS

The E484K mutation has been called the "escape mutation" because it could help COVID-19 evade a human immune response, and the S477N mutation creates spike proteins that affect how it attaches to cells.

The paper pointed out that the study has not been peer-reviewed.

Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, said, "Given the involvement of E484K or S477N, combined with the fact that the New York region has a lot of standing immunity from the spring wave, this is definitely one to watch."Sidelined two weeks because of COVID-19 protocols, Claude Giroux had enough of watching Flyers games on TV.

"It's not that fun watching the guys play when you’re at home," he said.

Giroux made it fun playing with the Flyers. His 903rd career game tied him with Bill Barber for most in the regular season with Philadelphia. He also had three assists in his return from a coronavirus absence to lead the Flyers over the New York Rangers 4-3 on Wednesday night.

"Surprised would be an understatement," coach Alain Vigneault said. "I didn’t really know what to expect, but you could tell early on he had his game tonight."

Giroux, who played his first game since Feb. 7, led the Flyers with eight shots on goal, 12 total shot attempts, three points and was 8 of 11 on faceoffs.

"This was one of his better games all year," Vigneault said.

James van Riemsdyk and Shayne Gostisbehere each scored a power-play goal for the Flyers, who are 0-3-2 against Boston and 9-1-1 versus the rest of the East Division.

Chris Kreider scored a hat trick for the Rangers on three tap-ins in front.

"He’s a huge part of our team He got rewarded tonight," New York center Mika Zibanejad said. "He works obviously incredibly hard and he goes to the net. He does an unbelievable job, probably one of the best guys in the league in front."

Giroux, the Flyers' captain, sat out two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus and missed their loss Sunday to Boston at Lake Tahoe. But the 33-year-old played as though he never lost a step during his layoff and helped set up goals for Erik Gustafsson and Gostisbehere in the first period to give Philadelphia a 2-1 lead.

"I wasn’t thinking too much out there," Giroux said. "Just playing the game and having fun."

The Flyers counted on a return home to steady the team after they were humbled in a 7-3 loss to the Bruins and had dropped four of five overall. Carter Hart allowed six goals on 23 shots in the first two periods against Boston and hit the bench Wednesday night. Brian Elliott stopped 24 shots for the Flyers, who start a rugged stretch Saturday of six games in nine days — including three straight games at Pittsburgh.

Philadelphia also played again without Jakub Voracek, Travis Konecny, Oskar Lindblom and Scott Laughton because of COVID protocols, while the Rangers had the same issue with K’Andre Miller and Kaapo Kakko.

"We’d love to have all of our guys healthy and ready to go," Rangers coach David Quinn said before the game. "We’re no different than most teams in the league. We don’t have that luxury right now."

The Flyers got an NHL-high seventh power-play goal of the season from van Riemsdyk to make it 3-1 early in the second. Giroux hit Kevin Hayes, who went top shelf against Igor Shesterkin to make it 4-2 late in the second.

The Rangers posted video of Kreider playing the piano and then watched him hit all the right notes in his third career hat trick and first since December 2016.

Kreider’s first two goals were on the power play and his third one (eighth of the season) made it 4-3.

"The effort was there, no question," he said.

LEAVE OF ABSENCE

The Rangers played without star winger Artemi Panarin, on a leave of absence for personal reasons. Panarin’s former KHL coach levied abusive allegations against Panarin. He has denied the accusations and believed the KHL coach made the claim because Panarin has been outspoken about Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Quinn said he was "very, very confident" Panarin would be cleared and could soon rejoin the Rangers.

NaLyssa Smith scored 20 points, DiJonai Carrington had a double-double and the Lady Bears won their 10th game in a row Wednesday night, 70-51 over Oklahoma State to move within a win of at least a share of another conference title.

"I start thinking about conference championships when you get closer to clinching them," coach Kim Mulkey said. "Obviously we don’t want to share it. We’ll need to win two more after tonight, but the fun part is if we can beat Kansas State here Saturday, you can celebrate on your home floor. ... The confetti will fall and we’ll do all of that. But you’ve got to win the game first."

The Lady Bears (18-2, 13-1 Big 12) took control by scoring the last 17 points before halftime. But that came after a miserable stretch of nearly 9 1/2 minutes when they blew all of an early 14-point lead with nine turnovers while missing 11 of 12 shots.

"Once we started clicking, and once we see one shot fall in, it’s kind of like, lets build off it now," said point guard DiDi Richards, who had 11 assists. "And eventually that turned into a 17-0 run."

Carrington had 12 points and 11 rebounds for Baylor. Queen Egbo had 13 points and Moon Ursin 11, while Egbo and Smith both had nine rebounds.

The Lady Bears still have four games to play, but Oklahoma State (17-7, 13-5) became the first Big 12 team to complete its regular season. The Cowgirls had won nine of their 10 games since a 77-58 home loss to Baylor on Jan. 20.

Natasha Mack had 18 points and 18 rebounds for the Cowgirls, and Ja'Mee Asberry had 15 points.

Baylor scored the game's first seven points, and was up 16-2 when Egbo made a layup with 3:54 left in the first quarter. Mack then made a jumper to start a 19-2 run, which she ended with another jumper that made it 21-18 with 4:48 left in the second quarter.

Oklahoma State got 11 of its 21 first-half points off turnovers, taking the lead with consecutive baskets after turnovers by Smith. Mack's steal led to a 3-pointer by Fields that put the Cowgirls up 19-18, and Neferatali Notoa had a steal that set up a Mack's run-ending jumper — and their last points before halftime.

Smith then scored eight points in Baylor's half-ending run, starting it and ending it with layups. After Smith blocked a shot in the closing seconds, Carrington got the rebound and passed to Smith for a breakaway basket to made it 35-21 at halftime.

"She saw we had enough time, and she just took off," Mulkey said of Smith before referring to Carington's pass. "For her to see I need to lead her right now, we don’t have time to do much dribbling, was a very alert play by two kids that had to know how much time was on the clock. .... That was a big momentum boost for us right there, with NaLyssa running the flor like that and DiJonai recognizing it."

BIG PICTURE

Oklahoma State: The Cowgirls lost their 11th consecutive game in the series against Baylor, but still had a record-breaking regular season. Their 13 league wins were a school record, two more than they had ever had — they had won 11 Big 12 games five times, the most recent in 2017-18.

"A team that’s fighting for second, third place in the league, and a good team, well-coached team, a team that just has my upmost respect because of what they’ve done all year," Mulkey said. "Picked eighth in our conference, and look where they are."

Baylor: Carrington has scored in double figures in all seven games since her return from missing four games because of COVID-19 protocols. It was her first double-double for Baylor after nine in her four years at Stanford.

Gallinari broke the mark of nine 3-pointers by Steve Smith in a 1997 game against Seattle. The Hawks also eclipsed the overall team record by going 23 of 42.

Trae Young played like an All-Star, adding 33 points as the Hawks built a 27-point lead in the first half and were never threatened by the lackluster Celtics, who have lost three in a row.

Gallinari, one of the biggest free agents signed by the Hawks in an offseason spending spree, equaled the best scoring half of his career with 24 points over the first two quarters. He finished 10 of 12 from 3-point range and 13 of 16 overall.

"It's always great to make history," he said. "I'm very happy for that. Of course, when you set these kind of records and win the game, it feels way better."

Gallinari knocked down jumpers from just about anywhere on the court — most notably swishing a 3 from at the edge of the special MLK Day half-court logo that was used on a night honoring historically black colleges and universities.

"The dude was on fire," teammate John Collins said. "He could not miss. The entire team loves it when when they see a guy on fire like that. We're going to keep giving it to him until he burns out."

The Hawks led 72-49 at halftime and maintained a comfortable margin the rest of the way.

Gallinari turned in his best performance since joining the Hawks. His previous high was 20 points against Indiana on Feb. 13.

It was much-needed rebound for Young and the Hawks, who lost 112-111 at Cleveland the previous night on a last-second shot — just hours after Atlanta’s star guard learned he had been passed over for a spot in the March 7 All-Star Game to be held on his home court.

Young, an All-Star starter in 2020, ripped through the Celtics for 25 points in the first half. He is averaging 27.2 points a game, the most by any player passed over for the midseason showcase.

Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 17 points but missed all six of his attempts from 3-point range.

Jayson Tatum was held to 13 points on 4-of-20 shooting. He made just 1 of 8 from long range.

"It got away from us early," Tatum said. "They played well and made a bunch of shots. But we didn’t come with it today."

NICE PASS

The Hawks were having so much fun that Young doled out an assist to himself.

On an inbounds pass from the baseline, Young threw the ball off the back of Boston's Grant Williams, caught the deflection and went in for an uncontested layup.

SLUMPING CELTICS

Boston has lost eight of its last 11 games to drop two games below .500 (15-17) for the first time this season.

Coming off two tough defeats — an overtime setback at New Orleans and a three-point loss at Dallas — the Celtics totally fell apart against the Hawks.

With four games left until the All-Star break, Tatum said the team feels a sense of urgency.

"These are four very important games," he said. "We've got to dig deep and figure it out."

TIP-INS

Celtics: G Kemba Walker didn't dress in the second game of a back-to-back to help manage his comeback from a left knee injury. ... Boston briefly showed signs of life when the Hawks missed their first six shots of the third quarter. The Celtics closed to 73-56, but the Hawks snuffed out the rally with back-to-back 3s by Tony Snell and Collins.

He had 14 points and 11 rebounds in 25 minutes. ... F Cam Reddish missed his second straight game with a sore right Achilles. ...

San Antonio turned the ball over with 3.9 seconds remaining, giving Oklahoma City the ball with the score tied. Dort's corner 3-pointer dropped as the buzzer sounded, and his teammates mobbed him.

Dort, known mostly for his defense as a rookie last season, has improved as a perimeter shooter this season. He made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter against the Spurs.

"Lu’s changed it around, obviously, changed the narrative," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "It’s just him working hard, not getting down on himself, being confident. When you work hard, confidence comes with it because you believe in yourself."

Gilgeous-Alexander became the first Thunder player to score at least 40 points in a game since Russell Westbrook had 42 on March 20, 2019. He made 13 of 20 field goals, 10 of 11 free throws and shot 6 of 11 on 3s.

Gilgeous-Alexander was one of the NBA’s highest-scoring players to be left off the All-Star rosters, but he said there was "no extra push or anything like that" to score a lot of points and make a statement about being snubbed.

"I wouldn’t have known how much I had if my teammates weren’t telling me," he said. "I was so locked into the game, honestly, just trying to win. Big nights are huge, but personally, if we didn’t win tonight, I wouldn’t feel close to what I feel right now."

Dort and Al Horford each scored 16 points for the Thunder.

Dejounte Murray had 27 points and Patty Mills added 15 for the Spurs.

San Antonio hadn't played since Feb. 14 because of health and safety protocols, and the Spurs were still depleted. DeMar DeRozan, the team’s leading scorer, sat out for personal reasons. Rudy Gay, Keldon Johnson, Devin Vassell, Quinnary Witherspoon and Derrick White were out because of health and safety protocols.

Gilgeous-Alexander took over in the third quarter. He hit a 3-pointer while being fouled, and his free throw cut San Antonio's lead to 53-51. He later drained a 3 to tie the game at 65.

His layup as time expired in the third put Oklahoma City up 76-73. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points in the period on 5-for-5 shooting from the field and 8 for 9 at the free throw line.

"I just wanted to be aggressive, try to put the defense on their heels, and from there, make the right play," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "Oftentimes, I found myself in position to score in that quarter."

Horford's 3-pointer on an assist from Gilgeous-Alexander put the Thunder up 87-86 with about seven minutes remaining, and the game remained close from there.

TIP-INS

Spurs: LaMarcus Aldridge returned after missing six games due to hip soreness. He had 11 points and seven rebounds. ... San Antonio went 5 of 10 on 3-pointers in the second quarter. ... The Spurs made 10 of 15 free throws.

Thunder: Made six 3-pointers in the first quarter while holding the Spurs to one. San Antonio didn't make one until the final minute of the period. ... Missed all seven of their 3-point tries in the second quarter. ... Hamidou Diallo did not play in the second half because of left groin soreness.

NEW ROLE

Aldridge came off the bench for the first time since the 2006-07 season — his rookie year. He's not sure if the move is permanent.

"It was fine," he said. "Very different. Still trying to figure it out, how to be ready to go. It’s definitely a different task coming off the bench, having very few minutes to get loose and kind of find a rhythm. I’m still figuring it out. It wasn’t perfect tonight, and I don’t think it’s going to be perfect for a while. It’s going to take some time for me to figure it out."

STAT LINE

Thunder forward Darius Bazley missed all eight of his shots from the floor and went scoreless, but had 10 rebounds in 30 minutes.

Good thing for the 25th-ranked Vols who still have issues to fix as the regular season winds to a close.

Victor Bailey Jr. made 5-of-8 3-pointers and finished with 21 points as Tennessee beat in-state rival Vanderbilt 70-58 Wednesday night to sweep the season series.

Tennessee (16-6, 9-6 Southeastern Conference) won its eight straight in the series and 10th in the last 11 games between the teams.

Jaden Springer added 20 points, and Yves Pons had 10 points and 10 rebounds. The Vols turned the ball over 17 times, far too much for coach Rick Barnes' comfort.

"We turned the ball over just way too much, especially early," Barnes said. "And we’ve got to stop turn the ball over. Good thing probably they didn’t have those two guys with the way we were turning the ball over."

Vanderbilt (6-13, 2-11) lost its third straight with Scotty Pippen Jr., the SEC’s second-leading scorer averaging 20.5 points a game sidelined by injury along with Dylan Disu, named the SEC player of the week after putting up back-to-back double-doubles last week. Clevon Brown also missed a second straight game.

Coach Jerry Stackhouse said after the game that Disu, leading the SEC with 9.2 rebounds per game, will have surgery Friday to repair meniscus in his knee. Pippen will have an MRI on Thursday to check a hip flexor.

"We're a little undermanned, had some lineups out there that we really hadn't used much this year, but I thought those guys played their butts off and gave themselves a chance to make a play or two at the end but came up short," Stackhouse said.

Trey Thomas led Vanderbilt with 14 points. Maxwell Evans had 13, Isaac McBride 11.

The Vols lost to Kentucky last weekend, dropping them to their lowest ranking this season.

The teams swapped spurts and the lead in the first half, but Tennessee took control for good by finishing on a 15-2 run capped by Olivier Nkamhoua's layup with 1:04 left for a 32-22 halftime lead.

Tennessee led by as much as 17 on a 3-pointer by Bailey with 16:58 remaining. Vanderbilt kept shooting from outside the arc, making eight 3s in the half and pulled within 56-52 with 4:27 left on a dunk by Maxwell Evans.

"My teammates were finding me getting me open looks, and I was able to hit them," Bailey said. "So hopefully it continues. And next time we hopefully we can not let other teams get so hot against us."

But Evans missed the free throw after being fouled, and Wright missed the front end of a 1-and-1.

Keon Johnson answered with two free throws and a dunk for Tennessee, then fellow freshman Springer scored on a layup, hit two free throws and added another layup to seal the victory.

BIG PICTURE

Tennessee: The Volunteers needed a big win with Auburn on Saturday their last scheduled game of the regular season. They came in fifth in the SEC standings trying to climb higher to avoid playing on Thursday of the conference tournament in two weeks in Nashville.

Vanderbilt: Stackhouse used his 13th different starting lineup this season in this game. Pippen had been the only Commodore to start every game this season before Wednesday night and snapped a 32-game starting streak.

OUTSIDE SHOOTING

Vanderbilt stayed in this game by shooting well from 3. The Commodores came in second in the SEC making 9.2 3s a game, and they went 13-of-33 from 3. But they were 3-of-6 at the free throw line compared to 18-of-22 for the Vols.

Rita Rich-Mulcahy, who lives in Australia, began knitting the little pigs to deal with her grief after her husband died last year and set up a Facebook page devoted to the creations, according to the Telegraph.

Recently, the self-described "porcophile" found herself accused of "hate speech" by the tech company because she used the term "white pigs" in a comment under a photo about white rabbits and she captioned one of her pig photos "high-viz pigs." Facebook also removed the posts.

Rich-Mulcahy said for someone who never even had so much as an overdue library book, an accusation of "hate speech" was "frightening."

CONSERVATIVE LEADERS CALL FOR STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL TO PROBE FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND GOOGLE OVER LIBERAL BIAS

"One was on February 1, when a friend in Shrewsbury posted 'white rabbits, white rabbits' as it was the first of the month. And I said 'No, white pigs, white pigs!' Everyone on the knit site and my page knows I am a porcophile," she explained, according to the Shropshire Star. "Facebook obviously uses a bot to trawl around Facebook and I had made two comments, totally innocent, which the bot saw as hate speech."

Facebook eventually apologized for the "mistake" and restored the posts. The company did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

"Our systems made a mistake here and the comments have now been reinstated. We do sometimes make mistakes when reviewing content, which is why we give people the opportunity to appeal against our decisions."

The pigs Rich-Mulcahy began knitting last year, which have names like Pigcasso and Francis Bacon, will be sold to raise money for a charity that helps disadvantaged children, according to the Telegraph.
